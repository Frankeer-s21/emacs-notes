* How to use this

Before you start working on a task, do a git pull to see if anyone
else has started working on it. If you're starting on a task, tag it
with your name and change the TODO to STARTED. Clocking in and out is
nice. =) You can start with the tasks ready for delegation, but also
feel free to take a look at the other tasks in the file and
suggest/volunteer. =) When discussing, add your initials followed by a
colon and your notes (or create a subtree).

*** Processes
**** Creating the hangout

- [X] Go to plus.google.com; optionally, log in as Emacs Conferences and Hangouts.
- [X] Create an Event with the proper timezone information. Be sure to invite Public when creating the event, as you can’t add this afterwards. I usually set the location to “Google Hangouts URL will be posted here close to the event start.” or something like that.
- [X] Set up redirection  http://sachachua.com/blog/wp-admin/tools.php?page=redirection.php
- [X] Announce on Twitter and other places.
- [X] Add to calendar

Check the event's description close to the event to see the join URL. 

*What's this Emacs Hangout thing about?* This is an informal way for Emacs geeks to get together and swap tips/notes/questions. Beginners welcome! (We're all learners here anyway... =) )

You can find out about upcoming Hangouts at https://plus.google.com/b/108840863190686221561/108840863190686221561/posts . Check out http://sachachua.com/blog/tag/emacs-hangout for the notes for past hangouts or sign up for the mailing list there to get notifications. The recording will be available from this event page as well. Enjoy, and thanks for coming!

Google Events translates event times to your local timezone. For reference, this event is on Dec 21 at 9 PM Toronto time (GMT -5).

Hi, folks!

Come join us at another Emacs Hangout in a couple of weeks: Monday,
Dec 21, starting at 9 PM EST (GMT-5).

http://sachachua.com/watch-emacs-hangout has details, and Google+
should automatically translate the time there to your timezone. 

If this time is inconvenient for you, get in touch with me and suggest
a few dates/times when you might want to have an Emacs Hangout. I'd be
happy to see if we can work out a good time, or to share my processes
for hosting these so that you can hold an hangout of your own. (It's
totally informal. =) )

You can find notes for past Emacs Hangouts at

Hope to see you there!

   Text chat:

   | Eric Hanchrow | 8:56 PM | I'm so much more comfortable with text than video ... if other people join, will I see their icons? |
   | me | 8:56 PM | Yup. Text chat is totally cool, it gets saved and posted too. and I can read things into the audio for people just listening to the stream (Livestream viewers won't see the text chat during the hangout - only people in the actual Hangout will see it, so that's why I repeat cool stuff.  ) |
   | Eric Hanchrow | 8:57 PM | uh ... so "livestream" is something different from Hangout? :-\ livestream must be "read only" |
   | me | 8:58 PM | Yup, livestream (Youtube, etc.) is read only |
   | Eric Hanchrow | 8:58 PM | ah dinnertime already! |

| Paul Harper | 2:59 PM | Something for beginners like me.  A course in research tools which includes some clear videos on using Emacs.

It looks like the stylus reports mouse-movement event right away, so thet in cancels the button press.
Yup, that was it. If I comment out the check for mouse-movement, it's okay. I never drag with my mouse anyway, so maybe I should just override this in my config.

<johnw> sachac: I wonder if you'd be willing to craft a "starter's guide" to
        getting involved in the Emacs community.  This would be things like a
        list of places to go for: starting out with .emacs file
        customizations; how to contribute code to the Emacs project; and the
        various communities that exist for people wanting to ask questions and
        join discussions about Emacs.
<johnw> sachac: I feel like our "offerings" are quite scattered through the
        web, and we're lacking that "start here" type of place

<choki> sachac: :D
<sachac> johnw: I'll probably modify
         http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/LearningEmacs and set up some kind of
