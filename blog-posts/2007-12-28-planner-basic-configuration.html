If you're the kind of person who likes scribbling free-form tasks and
 notes in your day planner, then Planner might be a good fit for you.
 In this blog post, I'll show you how to use Planner to organize the
 things you need to do by the day you need to do them, check the things
 you need to do, mark tasks complete, and review what you've finished.
 I assume that you've already got GNU Emacs 22 installed and that
 you're comfortable with using Emacs as a text editor, although it
 might not yet be your way of life. (Just you wait! Planner was the
 thing that pushed me over the edge. ;) )
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1">Set up</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
Here's the bare minimum you need in order to use Planner to manage
 your tasks day by day. You'll need Planner, which is a separate
 package that you can get from
<a href="http://www.gna.org/projects/planner-el"><a href="http://www.gna.org/projects/planner-el">http://www.gna.org/projects/planner-el</a></a>
 . As of this writing, Planner is at version 3.41. You'll also need
 Muse, the markup engine that Planner is based on. You can get Muse
 from
<a href="https://gna.org/projects/muse-el"><a href="https://gna.org/projects/muse-el">https://gna.org/projects/muse-el</a></a> .
As of this writing, Muse is at
 version 3.11.
</p>

<p>
Download the latest versions of Planner and Muse, and unpack them. If
 you don't know where to unpack them, I suggest creating an ~/elisp
 directory and extracting the archives to that directory. You should
 end up with two new directories: ~/elisp/planner-3.41 and
 ~/elisp/muse-3.11.
</p>

<p>
Here's how to configure Planner:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Create a directory such as ~/Plans . This is where your Planner pages
</li>
</ol>
<p>
will be.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Add the following to your .emacs:
</li>
</ol>

<pre class="example">
;; Load paths - change as necessary
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/elisp/planner-3.41")
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/elisp/muse-3.11/lisp")  ;; (1)

;; Basic configuration
(require 'muse-project)
(require 'planner-autoloads)
(setq planner-project "WikiPlanner")

;; Adjust this if you already have other Muse projects
(setq muse-project-alist
      '(("WikiPlanner"
     ("~/Plans"                          ;; (2)
      :default "TaskPool"                ;; (3)
          :major-mode planner-mode
          :visit-link planner-visit-link)))

;; Some handy keyboard shortcuts
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c d") 'planner-goto)                            ;; (4)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c t") 'planner-create-task-from-buffer)
(global-set-key (kbd "&lt;f9&gt; d") 'planner-goto)                     ;; (5)
(global-set-key (kbd "&lt;f9&gt; t") 'planner-create-task-from-buffer)
(global-set-key (kbd "&lt;f9&gt; &lt;f9&gt;") 'planner-goto-today)      ;; (6)
(global-set-key (kbd "&lt;f9&gt; &lt;f8&gt;") 'planner-goto-yesterday)  ;; (7)
(global-set-key (kbd "&lt;f9&gt; &lt;f10&gt;") 'planner-goto-tomorrow)

(plan)  ;; (8)
</pre>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>(1) The lisp/ subdirectory is added to the load-path, not the base
directory.
</li>
<li>(2) Change this if you put your planner projects somewhere else.
</li>
<li>(3) Muse will open the default page if you open a project.
</li>
<li>(4) You'll use these two commands often, so it helps to keep them
close by. You can remember them as C-c d(ate), which jumps to a
Planner date, and C-c t(ask), which creates a Planner task.
</li>
<li>(5) I like dedicating one of my function keys to different Planner
shortcuts. “F9 d(ate)” jumps to a Planner date and F9 t(ask) creates
a task.
</li>
<li>(6) You'll check today's page frequently, so make it an easy-to-hit
shortcut. I like F9 F9 because I can just tap the key twice to see my
tasks and schedule.
</li>
<li>(7) This pair of keyboard shortcuts make it easy to navigate through
pages.
</li>
<li>(8) If this line is one of the last few in your ~/.emacs, then your
Planner page for the day will display every time you start Emacs.
It's a good way to remember that it exists. ;)
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Evaluate the code with M-x eval-buffer, or restart Emacs. Then you're
 ready to plan!

<h2 id="sec-2">Planner and day pages</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
The first thing you need to learn is how to get to day pages
 quickly. Planner needs to be at least as fast as opening a paper-based
 day planner and finding the right page. Here are the two keybindings
 from the previous section on setting up Planner:
</p>

<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">


<colgroup>
<col  class="left" />

<col  class="left" />

<col  class="left" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="left">F9 d(ate) or C-c d</td>
<td class="left">planner-goto</td>
<td class="left">Jumps to any day's page</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="left">F9 F9</td>
<td class="left">planner-goto-today</td>
<td class="left">Shows today's page</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>
F9 d (planner-goto) is smart. You can click on a date in the calendar
 that pops up, or navigate to a date and press RET. Typing in the date
 is much faster. The date format is yyyy.mm.dd, and it understands
 partial dates (mm.dd, or just dd).
</p>

<p>
For example, if the date today is December 28, 2007, here's what
</p>

<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">


<colgroup>
<col  class="right" />

<col  class="right" />

<col  class="left" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="right">Example</td>
<td class="right">Result</td>
<td class="left">Explanation</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="right">.</td>
<td class="right">2007.12.28</td>
<td class="left">Today</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="right">30</td>
<td class="right">2007.12.30</td>
<td class="left">Which day in the current month</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="right">1.30</td>
<td class="right">2007.01.30</td>
<td class="left">Which day and month in the current year</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="right">2008.01.30</td>
<td class="right">2008.01.30</td>
<td class="left">The full date</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>
planner-goto also understands relative dates, and this is where things
 get more interesting. If you are looking at a day page, dates are
 calculated based on the day you're currently looking at, or today if
 you're not looking at a day page. This allows you to use “+2fri” to
 jump to successive paydays or use -1 to see the day before the one
 you're reading. Here are some examples that will show you what you can
do:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Jump to the day page for December 28, 2007 with F9 d or C-c d,
specifying 2007.12.28 for the date.
</li>
<li>Use F9 d +5 to jump five days ahead. You should now see the page for
2008.01.02.
</li>
<li>Use F9 d -3 to jump three days back. (2007.12.30)
</li>
<li>Use F9 d +tue to jump to the next Tuesday. (2008.01.01)
</li>
<li>Use F9 d -2fri to jump to two Fridays ago. (2007.12.21)
</li>
<li>Use F9 d +2wed2007.12.01 to jump to the second Wednesday after Dec 1,
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>(2007.12.12). +2wed01 would have worked, too.
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
(If you ever find yourself using a date shortcut like the one in (6),
 please e-mail me, as I put that code in just for fun. =) )
</p>

<p>
Practice jumping around to different dates using F9 d or C-c d, the
 two shortcuts we set up earlier. If one of those shortcuts feels more
 natural to you, go ahead and use it. (Or bind it to something else, if
 you want.) While you're opening different day pages, write a few
 reminders to yourself.
</p>

<p>
The basic configuration I suggested also has some handy shortcuts for
 going to the previous and next days. Press F9 F8
 (planner-goto-yesterday) to go to the day before the one that's
 currently displayed, and F9 F10 (planner-goto-tomorrow) to go to the
 day after the one that's displayed. You'll find this handy when doing
 your weekly planning. The standard shortcuts are C-c C-j C-y and C-c
 C-j C-t. You may find those easier to type, but they were like a game
 of Twister on my tiny keyboard. (This is also the reason why I've
 remapped most of my keybindings. I simply can't do the
 Escape-Meta-Alt-Control-Shift thing.)
</p>

<p>
So now you know how to open different day pages. You can stop here and
 already have a decent, minimalist day planner, using it like a
 collection of text files that just happen to have useful navigational
 commands. However, with a little more structure and some handy
 shortcuts, you can be even more effective at managing your tasks.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3">Creating tasks</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
Two of the keyboard shortcuts in the sample configuration are C-c t
 and F9 t, both bound to planner-create-task-from-buffer. This is an
 incredibly useful function, and it gets even better as you set up more
 parts of Planner. The key idea behind planner-create-task-from-buffer
 is that you should be able to quickly jot down a task and GET BACK TO
 WORK RIGHT AWAY. No need to fiddle around with other files or dig your
 planner out of your backpack. No switching to another application (at
 least, if you do most of your work within Emacs). And if you set it
 up, you even get hyperlinks back to whatever you were looking at,
 saving you time in searching for the file you wanted to work on or the
 e-mail you wanted to answer.
</p>

<p>
Try it for yourself. Use C-c t, F9 t, or M-x
 planner-create-task-from-buffer to create a task. Type in the task
 description. For now, accept the default date and plan page. The task
 will be created on today's page. The task will also be copied to the
 <a href="http://sachachua.com/notebook/wiki/TaskPool">TaskPool</a> page. To view
today's page, type F9 F9. You can use TAB
 (muse-next-reference) to move the cursor to the next hyperlink, and
 RET to visit the link.
</p>

<p>
planner-create-task-from-buffer understands all the date shortcuts
 that planner-goto does, so you can easily schedule a task for this
 Saturday (+sat) or three days from now (+3). If you create a task
 that's scheduled for some other day, you can either open the day page
 with F9 d (planner-goto), or review it on the
<a href="http://sachachua.com/notebook/wiki/TaskPool">TaskPool</a>.
</p>

<p>
Okay. You've got day pages. You've got tasks. You probably want to
 find out how to mark tasks as done before your growing TODO list turns
 into a monster and eats you.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-4">Marking tasks as done, pending, or cancelled</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
When you finish a task, go to the day page or the plan page it's on
 and use C-c C-x (planner-task-done) to mark it as finished. Think of
 it as marking completed tasks with a big X. In addition to the
 satisfaction of seeing completed tasks grayed and crossed out, you'll
 also see the completed tasks drop to the bottom of your task list when
 you save the file. This makes it easy to see what else you need to
 do. Just pick the next item off your list and keep working.
</p>

<p>
Not quite done? You can mark it as pending with C-c C-p
 (planner-task-pending). You can think of it as Pending or Postponed or
 Procrastinated.
</p>

<p>
Realized that you didn't need to do it after all? Either delete the
 task with M-x planner-delete-task, or mark it as cancelled with C-c
 M-C-x (planner-task-cancelled). Think of C-c M-C-x as similar to C-c
 C-x (planner-task-done), but even better&#x2014;you've gotten away without
 doing something. C-c M-C-x doesn't work on all terminals, so if your
 computer gets confused and marks the task as done, call M-x
 planner-task-cancelled instead.
</p>

<p>
NOTE: If your task is on both a day page and a plan page, make sure
 you use these Planner commands and M-x planner-edit-task-description
 in order to change the task status or description, and M-x
 planner-delete-task to delete the task. These commands update the
 linked page as well. If not, your tasks could get out of sync.
</p>

<p>
Even with your newfound powers of Planner task management, you'll
 probably still be left with unfinished business at the end of the day.
 Unfortunately, Planner does not have a M-x planner-dilate-time command,
 so you'll just have to reschedule the tasks for another day.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-5" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-5">Rescheduling tasks</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<p>
If you wrote your tasks into your calendar using a paper-based
 planner, you'd have to copy unfinished tasks to the next day one by
 one. This is a powerful incentive to trim your task list and keep it
 short. Planner can automatically copy unfinished tasks from the
 previous days onto today's page, saving you a lot of scribbling. Do
 not let this tempt you into procrastination.
</p>

<p>
If you go back to the basic configuration, you'll notice that it ends
 with one command:
</p>

<pre class="example">
(plan)
</pre>

<p>
This reviews the past few days of pages for unfinished tasks, carrying
 them over to today's page. By default, the past 3 days are checked,
 which should be enough to get you through a blissful no-computer
 weekend. If you're in the habit of going for long spans of time
 without opening Emacs (like 4 days! <b>gasp</b>), you may want to change
 the line in your ~/.emacs to something like
</p>

<pre class="example">
(plan 5)        ;; Check the last 5 days
</pre>

<p>
or even
</p>

<pre class="example">
(plan t)        ;; Check all days. Can be slow!
</pre>

<p>
You can also call this interactively with something like C-u 5 M-x
 plan, which checks the last 5 days.
</p>

<p>
plan carries unfinished tasks from previous days to today. What if you
 want to trim today's task list to a manageable size by proactively and
 intentionally procrastinating things that you don't need to do today?
 That's where planner-copy-or-move-task comes in.
</p>

<p>
To reschedule a task, move your cursor to the task on the day or plan
 page. Type C-c C-c (planner-copy-or-move-task) and specify the
 date. Again, planner-copy-or-move-task understands all the Planner
 date shortcuts. If you reschedule a task from a day page, remember
 that relative dates will be calculated based on the day page. For
 example, if you're on 2008.08.12 and you want to reschedule a task, +1
 means 2008.08.13. If you reschedule a task from a plan page, dates are
 relative to today.
</p>

<p>
If you want to reschedule many tasks, you might find it more
 convenient to use M-x planner-copy-or-move-region. Move to the
 beginning of the first task you want to move, press C-SPC to mark the
 beginning of the region, move to the end of the last task you want to
 move, and call M-x planner-copy-or-move-region.
</p>

<p>
Ruthlessly reschedule until your task list for today looks
 manageable. A large task list can be overwhelming. It feels better to
 complete everything on your task list and then add some more, than to
 end each day with many unfinished tasks.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-6" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-6">Review</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-6">
<p>
You've got your day pages. You've added and scheduled tasks. You've
 checked them off. At the end of the week, you're wondering where all
 the time went. Just hit F9 F9 (planner-goto-today) to jump to today's
 page, and then use F9 F8 (planner-goto-yesterday) and F9 F10
 (planner-goto-tomorrow) to navigate around. (See, those keybindings
 were there for a reason!)
</p>

<p>
But wait, there's more! I'll cover projects, timeclocking, and other
 Planner goodies in an intermediate article on using Planner, so stay
 tuned.
