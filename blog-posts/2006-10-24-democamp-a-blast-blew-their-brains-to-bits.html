I set out to geek the heck out of Toronto's hippest geeks, and I did.
 I showed them Emacs as they'd never seen it before&#x2014;and even that was
 a tiny fraction of my config. Lots of cool stuff behind the scenes,
 too. When I showed them M-x doctor (the Emacs psychotherapist),
 someone shouted out, “Is Emacs talking to you?” I laughed and
 continued. What I <b>really</b> should've done was break the sequence of my
 presentation, hook up the speakers, and tell them about Emacspeak -
 presentation sequence be darned. ;) Oh, if they only knew how easy it
 was to make jokes reality under Emacs! I remember writing my ‘bot
 implants' &#x2013; the hippie-expand code I used to answer questions really
 really quickly on IRC&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Anyway. That was FUN. And it was relatively easy to get through,
 especially with the cue system I made (Emacspeak rocks!). I'll talk
 about that some other time. It's a really cool hack and well worth
exploring.
</p>

<p>
SO. The <a href="http://democamp.ca">democamp.ca</a> folks will eventually get
 around to posting a vidcast. In the meantime, I have a 431MB MPEG
 movie that I need to either downsample or cut up in order to put
 online, maybe on <a href="http://www.youtube.com">YouTube</a>. I don't have
 enough memory or hard disk space to play around with this (have you
 seen my computer?!), but I'll happily put the video up if we can
 figure out how to go about doing that.
</p>

<p>
If you enjoyed the talk, missed it, or just want to hear/see me bounce
 up and down about Emacs some more, come to the
<b><a href="http://www.linuxcaffe.ca">Linux Caffe</a></b>
 on <b>Saturday (Oct 28, 2006) from 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM</b>. I'll be there,
 and we might even see about having some kind of mini-show / vidcast. I
wonder if
 David has a projector. =)
</p>

<p>
That was fun! Can't wait to do it again!
