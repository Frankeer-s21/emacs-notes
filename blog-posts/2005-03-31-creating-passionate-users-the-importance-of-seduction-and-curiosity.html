<a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2005/03/the_importance_.html">“The
importance of seduction and curiosity”</a> is another great entry from one
of my favorite blogs,

Passionate Users</a>. Kathy Sierra writes:

Part of creating passionate users starts with building curiosity.
Inspire them to want to learn, know, and do more.

<p>
I love making people curious about things, whether it's Emacs,
 Planner, computer science, or even far-out stuff like street
 performance.
</p>

<p>
Kathy Sierra gives these tips:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Be passionately curious yourself.
</li>
<li>Be seductive.
</li>
<li>Make them curious by doing something unusual, without an obvious
explanation.
</li>
<li>Offer a puzzle or interesting question&#x2026; without giving them the
solution.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
<b>Be passionately curious yourself.</b> Heck yeah. I love learning
 about things. When people give me feedback on my talk, the first thing
 that usually comes to their mind is my enthusiasm for the topic. Even
 when I can't go into a lot of detail about something like Squeak, they
 pick up on the fact that I think it's really interesting and something
 worth being curious about.
</p>

<p>
<b>Be seductive.</b> I often do my Planner help that way when the
 person I'm talking to expresses interest in learning Lisp. I'll take
 them partway to a solution and leave enough for them to figure things
 out. Even with the hacks we put together for Planner, there's always
 that tantalizing glimpse of what \<sub>else\</sub>_ could be possible.
</p>

<p>
<b>Make them curious by doing something unusual, without an obvious
 explanation.</b> This is why I've taken to starting my Knoppix
 presentations with a Windows display. ;)
</p>

<p>
<b>Offer a puzzle or interesting question&#x2026; without giving them the
 solution.</b> Oooh, still have to figure out how to do this one
 properly.
</p>

<p>
Fun.
