I came across
<a href="http://blog.chrislowis.co.uk/2010/10/26/laptop-driven-development-with-emacs.html">this
comment</a> on Chris Lowis' blog post about small-screen development in
Emacs:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Alex: I can't be geek enough to use Emacs&#x2026; it's not that I think the
 editor is bad: it's the excessive number of keys to press to
 accomplish anything.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
It made me stop and think, because one of the things I love about Emacs
is that I can press lots of keys to accomplish anything.
</p>

<p>
What's the alternative? Mouse clicks? Eeew.
</p>

<p>
My most-common keyboard shortcuts are one or two keys long. Yes, there
are many of them, and I use a small subset depending on what I'm working
on. If I forget the keyboard shortcut for something, or I want to run a
command that doesn't have a keyboard shortcut, I use M-x (which is
really Alt-x on my keyboard) to call the function by name (ex: M-x
shell-command-on-region, which turns out to have M-| as a shortcut).
</p>

<p>
I hardly ever type entire function names. <code>icomplete-mode</code> offers
autocompletion for M-x. I also shows me the keyboard shortcuts for a
command in order to help me work more efficiently.
</p>

<p>
If I like something a lot, I can easily define a keyboard shortcut for
it using global-set-key. I can set mode-specific keyboard shortcuts so
that some shortcuts are active when I'm programming and inactive when
I'm not. I can load sets of shortcuts depending on what I want to do.
It's incredibly flexible. Yes, it requires some learning, but it's been
well worth the investment for me.
</p>

<p>
Because you only have so many keys on a keyboard, it's useful to be able
to define multiple-key shortcuts. I'd rather type Ctrl-c r t than
Ctrl-Alt-Shift-R or something like that. (Or worse: spend time looking
for just the right toolbar button, and try to click on it with the
mouse.) I think of it like super-fast selection through a menu that
makes sense to me. In my case, Ctrl-c turned out to be easier to get to
than F9 (which I'd previously been using for personal shortcuts), r
means remember, and t means task.
</p>

<p>
You might think that a keyboard-driven editor is slow, but it's fast
enough to keep up with me, and I can probably code circles around you.
;)
