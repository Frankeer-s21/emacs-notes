<p>
How can I keep in touch with other people?
</p>

<p>
One way is to call people up or write them a friendly note every so
 often. I find this difficult to do because I'm still not used to small
 talk. I'm also not used to being interrupted for a purely social call
 unless it's someone I know well. I'm much more comfortable dealing
 with information. I want to be useful.
</p>

<p>
First, I need to keep track of people's interests. When I run across
 something that might be useful for them, I can send them the
 information. If I also keep track of other little facts I know about
 people, then I can make them feel a little more special.
</p>

<p>
Second, I should regularly refresh my contacts. I should make sure I
 keep in touch with people. Maybe I should set goals for how often I
 should get in touch with different kinds of people. There are people I
 don't expect further contact with, there are people I should write at
 least once a year, and there are people I'd like to correspond with
 more frequently.
</p>

<p>
The next step would be to proactively search for useful information.
 If I periodically read about other people's interests, I will not only
 learn many new things and gain more common ground with them, but might
 also find resources they haven't run across before.
</p>

<p>
WHAT I CURRENTLY HAVE:
</p>

<p>
I already keep notes on people in my BBDB (Big Brother Database,
 Emacs). BBDB makes it easy for me to associate notes with e-mail.
 Whenever I read a message from someone in my address book, the BBDB
 record pops up and I can review or add notes easily.
</p>

<p>
However, I don't regularly review these contacts or make a conscious
 effort to stay in touch with a wide range of people. I tend to react
 instead of act, and I'd like to change that.
</p>

<p>
WHAT I'D LIKE TO HAVE:
</p>

<p>
I would like to be able to see my contacts grouped by relative
 frequency. This would allow me to flip through, say, all the people I
 have yet to contact this year, and randomly pick people to get in
 touch with. I need to also keep track of our last few communications,
 in terms of both when I got in touch with that person and when I got a
 reply.
</p>

<p>
I would like to be able to see my contacts grouped by interest. I can
 achieve the same effect by searching through the records for a
 particular keyword. This would allow me to easily look up all the
 people I should get in touch with regarding a particular topic.
</p>

<p>
I would like to be able to create tasks based on each contact or group
 of contacts. I should be able to list all the tasks associated with a
 particular person as well as see the tasks on my day page, perhaps
 under the “social” context.
</p>

<p>
WHAT I CAN DO:
</p>

<p>
First, I should add two fields to my BBDB records to keep track of the
 last time I spoke/wrote to the person and the last time I received a
 reply. I can probably configure Gnus to update this automatically for
 mail, although I can also do that myself. I can also add an entry for
 maximum days without contact, or something like that.
</p>

<p>
I can add another field called “Next action”, which keeps track of the
 next thing I can do for that person.
</p>

<p>
I can write Emacs Lisp code to extract all the relevant information
 from BBDB and prioritize the list.
</p>

<p>
Hmmm. Sounds useful.
