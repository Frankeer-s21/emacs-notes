December 29th, 2004 -
<a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/p/2522"><a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/p/2522">http://sachachua.com/blog/p/2522</a></a>
</p>

<p>
Today I discovered the immense usefulness of keeping track of time. I
 had converted the TODO my teammate sent me into entries in my
 <a href="http://sachachua.com/notebook/wiki/JapanProject">JapanProject</a> plan
page, and before starting my work I came up with
 rough estimates of the time it would take me to do the tasks. I also
 marked which tasks I felt were best suited for my coworker so that he
 could get started without worrying about conflicts. I like working on
 little tasks first, so I estimated the time it would take me to
 complete each task and sorted by my estimates using the ‘sort' command
 and some cutting and pasting.
</p>

<p>
Then the fun began. I wanted to see if I could match my estimates.
 Before I started working on a task, I used C-c TAB to mark it ‘in
 progress' and start the clock. When I finished it, I used C-c C-x
 (planner-task-done) to mark it completed and automatically clock out.
 This is not yet done for cancelled tasks, so I clocked out of those
 manually with C-c C-o (timeclock-out). I also clocked out whenever I
 caught myself being distracted so that the totals wouldn't include the
 time I spent chatting on #emacs or checking out del.icio.us links. ;)
 At the end of the day, I used
 ‘planner-timeclock-summary-show-range-filter' to show me the time
 elapsed for all of the tasks I'd worked on over the past two days.
 Here's the report for that project, edited to reflect how it looks on
 my screen and annotated with comments:

Day began: 13:03:58, Day ended: 20:51:46
 Time elapsed: 31:47:48, Time clocked: 10:41:41
 Time clocked ratio: 33.6%
</p>

<p>
The time record isn't perfect. I cancelled some tasks after thinking
 about them a little and did some tasks simultaneously. Sometimes I
 didn't notice that I was getting distracted, too. Still, having all of
 that time information neatly summarized made me realize a number of
 things.
</p>

<p>
First, I goof off much less when I have a nice, broken-down task list
 in front of me. There's just something about knowing there's a five-
 or ten-minute hack you can get out of the way. I found myself looking
 forward to getting to the next task just to see if I could make my
 estimate. That said, seeing a five-minute task stretch and stretch due
 to unforeseen problems did make me a little nervous. I should probably
 just make generous estimates so that I don't end up with bugs because
 of haste.
</p>

<p>
Second, I don't goof off as much as I thought I did, although there's
 still room for improvement. Yesterday's workday was 9:00 &#x2013; 12:00, 1:00
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>5:30&#x2014;7.5 hours. Today was the last day of work, so cleaning and
</li>
</ul>
<p>
celebration interrupted my hacking at around 3:00&#x2014;5 hours of work.
According to my task list, 10:41/12:30 was productive work. Hmm. 1:49
hours unclocked time when I was thinking or goofing off.
planner-timeclock-summary-show for today reveals that I actually
clocked 5:30 today, which means the goofing off happened yesterday.
That makes sense; I remember a pretty long unclocked segment
recuperating from Japanese overload. (This was before we came up with
the task list.)
</p>

<p>
Third, keeping track of time is way, way cool even if you don't bill
 anyone for your time.
</p>

<p>
Like the idea? It's easy to try out. If you use the development
 version of planner, just add
</p>

<pre class="example">
(require 'planner-timeclock)
(require 'planner-timeclock-summary)
</pre>

<p>
to your ~/.emacs. If you want to try it out now, eval those statements
 in your Emacs session. After that, simply use C-c TAB to ‘clock in' a
 task before you start working on it, and use C-c C-x
 (planner-task-done) to mark it completed. To see a summary of how you
 spent your day, check out the different functions in
 planner-timeclock-summary.
</p>

<p>
If you use the stable version of Planner, you
 can grab
<a href="http://sacha.free.net.ph/notebook/emacs/dev/planner/planner-timeclock.el">planner-timeclock.el</a>
 and
<a href="http://sacha.free.net.ph/notebook/emacs/dev/planner/planner-timeclock-summary.el">planner-timeclock-summary.el</a>
from
</p>

, try out the
 dev version, or cherry-pick the relevant arch patches. If it works for
 you too, please e-mail me so that we can merge it into stable! =) (I
 tend to trust myself very little, seeing how I manage to screw up dev
 from time to time.)

<p>
Happy hacking!
