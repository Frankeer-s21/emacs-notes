Sometimes it's hard to remember what it's like to be a beginner, so I'm
experimenting with asking other people to help me with this. =) I asked
one of my assistants to look for beginner tutorials for Emacs and
evaluate them based on whether they were interesting and easy to
understand. Here's what she put together! &#x2013; Sacha

<p>
<b><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRYzPWnk2mE">Emacs #1 - Getting Started and Playing Games by jekor</a></b>
 Probably the most helpful Emacs tutorial series on YouTube. Goes beyond
the “what to type” how-tos that other tutorials seem bent on explaining
over and over. Emphasizes games and how they help users familiarize
themselves with the all-keyboard controls. 5/5 stars
</p>

<p>
<b><a href="http://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org4beginners.html">Org-mode beginning at the basics</a></b>
 What it says on the tin. Essential resource for those who are new to
Emacs and org-mode. Provides steps on how to organize workflow using
org-mode written in a simple, nontechnical, writing style. 5/5 stars
</p>

<p>
<b><a href="http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/emacs.html">Xah Emacs Tutorial</a></b>
 Though the landing page says that the tutorial is for scientists and
programmers, beginners need not be intimidated! Xah Emacs Tutorial is
very noob-friendly. Topics are grouped under categories (e.g. Quick
Tips, Productivity, Editing Tricks, etc.) Presentation is a bit wonky
though. 4.5/5 stars
</p>

<p>
<b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16Rd46SE-20">RT 2011: Screencast 01 &#x2013; emacs keyboard introduction by Kurt Scwehr</a></b>
 Keyboard instruction on Emacs from the University of New Hampshire.
Very informative and also presents some of the essential keystrokes that
beginners need to memorize to make the most out of the program. But at
25 mins, I think that the video might be too long for some people. 4/5
stars
</p>

<p>
<b><a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/">Emacs Wiki</a></b>
Nothing beats the original- or in this case, the official- wiki. Covers
all aspects of Emacs operation. My only gripe with this wiki is that the
groupings and presentation are not exactly user-friendly (links are all
over the place!), and it might take a bit of time for visitors to find
what they are looking for. 4/5 stars
</p>

<p>
<b><a href="http://www.masteringemacs.org/articles/2010/10/04/beginners-guide-to-emacs/">Mastering Emacs: Beginner's Guide to Emacs</a></b>
 The whole website itself is one big tutorial. Topics can be
wide-ranging but it has a specific category for beginners.
 whole website itself is one big tutorial. Looks, feels, and reads more
like a personal blog rather than a straightforward wiki/tutorial. 4/5
stars
</p>

<p>
<b><a href="http://www.jesshamrick.com/2012/09/10/absolute-beginners-guide-to-emacs/">Jessica Hamrick's Absolute Beginner's Guide to Emacs</a></b>
 Clear and concise. Primarily focused on providing knowledge to people
who are not used to text-based coding environments. It covers a lot of
basic stuff, but does not really go in-depth into the topics. Perfect
for “absolute beginners” but not much else. 3/5 stars
</p>

<p>
<b><a href="http://www.jimmenard.com/emacs_tips.html">Jim Menard's Emacs Tips and Tricks</a></b>
 Personal tips and tricks from a dedicated Emacs user since 1981. Not
exactly beginner level, but there's a helpful trove of knowledge here.
Some chapters are incomplete. 3/5 stars
</p>

<p>
<b><a href="http://emacsredux.com/">Emacs Redux</a></b>
 Not a tutorial, but still an excellent resource for those who want to
be on the Emacs update loop. Constantly updated and maintained by an
Emacs buff who is currently working on a few Emacs related projects. 3/5
stars
</p>

<p>
<b><a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/emacs/emacs.html">Jeremy Zawodny's Emacs Beginner's HOWTO</a></b>
 Lots of helpful information, but is woefully not updated for the past
decade or so. 2/5 stars

This list was put together by Marie Alexis Miravite. In addition, you
might want to check out <a href="http://doc.norang.ca/org-mode.html">how Bernt Hansen uses Org</a>, which is also pretty cool.
