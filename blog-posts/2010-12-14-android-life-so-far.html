<p>
It's been three weeks since I bought my Android phone, and I'm having
lots of fun hacking it. <b>Here's what I'm doing with it now:</b>
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Tracking the time I spend on various activities so that I can (a) get
better at estimating time for travel and other things, (b) log my
work hours, and (c) find out where my time really went.
Experimenting with grocery tracking systems so that I can organize my
shopping list and track prices.
<a href="http://www.appbrain.com/app/grocery-tracker/easicorp.gtracker">GTracker</a>
seems okay, although there are a bunch of features I still want, so I
might build my own someday.
</li>
<li>Synchronizing my files with
<a href="http://www.appbrain.com/app/dropbox/com.dropbox.android">Dropbox</a>,
reviewing spreadsheets, and using the files in various applications.
</li>
<li>Mindmapping with
<a href="http://www.appbrain.com/app/thinking-space/net.thinkingspace">ThinkingSpace</a>,
which understands Freemind files I've downloaded with Dropbox.
</li>
<li>Taking pictures and sharing them on Facebook and
<a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/sachac/Phone#">Picasa</a>.
</li>
<li>Capturing notes, mostly with
<a href="http://www.appbrain.com/app/mobileorg/com.matburt.mobileorg">MobileOrg</a>.
Still tweaking this.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>What am I working on being able to do with my Android?</b>
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Retrieve contact data from BBDB:</b> I'm most of the way to being able
to show records from the Emacs Big Brother Database in my Android
contacts. Mwahaha! I've figured out how to parse the records with
StringTokenizer, interpret the alists, add information to records,
and add records to visible groups. I just want to set up a new
account manager for BBDB, and then group the items using mail
aliases. It took me a while to piece things together from bits of
documentation and tutorials. I'm looking forward to applying for
permission to share my BBDB stuff as open source, too.
</li>
<li><b>Improve Org interface:</b> I'm also most of the way towards making the
MobileOrg capture interface close to the MobileOrg iOS capture
interface, which I had been quite happy with. You
</li>
<li>*Check my Toodledo tasks:*None of the Toodledo clients I've tried are
as slick as Toodledo for iOS. Who knows, this might just push me back
into using Emacs Org to manage everything, with my org-toodledo for
syncing to the Web.
</li>
<li><b>Get better at using a timer:</b> Not quite Pomodoro technique, more
like a timer just to remind myself to stop doing something. =) The
open source <a href="http://www.appbrain.com/app/tea-timer/goo.TeaTimer">Tea
Timer</a> is a decent fit, and I've kludged it on my phone to make it
easier to add multiples of five minutes.
</li>
<li><b>Track my time in more detail:</b> Maybe with task-level tracking, or
finer categories for the things I care about?
</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>What am I learning?</b>
</p>

<p>
Looking at my preliminary stats from a little over two weeks of
tracking, I'm pleasantly surprised by how much time I spent on social
interaction &#x2013; more than I thought I did, looking back. I also get a
decent amount of walking and other exercise into my schedule. It takes
me about 13 minutes to walk to the subway station, and the subway ride
to work takes an average of 19 minutes &#x2013; a little over my estimate of
30 minutes travel time. I've been putting that time to good use,
listening to podcasts while walking, and writing Christmas cards if I
can get a seat.
</p>

<p>
I might shift our preparation routines around so that I can move more
non-computer things into weekday evenings. I want to do more blogging
and Android development in my personal time. Even though I take frequent
typing breaks to avoid those pangs of incipient RSI, a long day of
working on the computer is probably still a bad idea. ;) Most of our
weekend preparations involve laundry or cooking. Both are more
efficiently batched on the weekends &#x2013; cheaper electricity, too. Tidying
up and folding laundry can be done as a break that separates work from
evenings. Drawing might exercise different muscles (and different parts
of my brain). Investing time into training speech recognition might pay
off, too, although I get self-conscious about dictating when other
people are around. &lt;laugh&gt;
</p>

<p>
Definitely like my Android.
