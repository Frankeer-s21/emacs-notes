</p>

<p>
A friend and I were thinking of papers to submit to the Loyola Schools
 Review. I joked, “What could I write about
<a href="http://sachachua.com/notebook/wiki/PlannerMode">PlannerMode</a>?” It's
an
 organizer that I happen to really like, but which I don't think I can
 get other teachers to adopt (Emacs'll scare the heck out of them!).
</p>

<p>
I thought about why I liked
<a href="http://sachachua.com/notebook/wiki/PlannerMode">PlannerMode</a>. Planner
as a TODO manager
 isn't particularly special. Although I can assign tasks to categories
 and so see a breakdown of what projects are taking up my time,
 Evolution and Microsoft Outlook provide more powerful task support. In
 other task managers, you can e-mail tasks, assign multiple categories
 and fill in all sorts of metadata. You can even synchronize your tasks
 with devices like a phone or PDA. So why use Planner?
</p>

<p>
I realized that integration into my way of life and automatic context
 clues are what really make planner tasks worth it for me. I don't have
 to switch to another application to create a task. I can just hit a
 keyboard shortcut. Planner uses a minibuffer to get the task
 description. My windows are not rearranged in any way, and I can look
 at the data that's relevant to a task. Not only that, tasks
 automatically pick up context clues, like whom I'm talking to on IRC
 or the file I'm editing at the moment. This cuts down on the explicit
 context I need to include and makes it easier for me to bring up the
 task again.
</p>

<p>
As a scheduler,
<a href="http://sachachua.com/notebook/wiki/PlannerMode">PlannerMode</a> is also
not particularly distinguished.
 Sure, it can display my ~/diary, but for that matter so can M-x diary.
 Evolution and Outlook can give me a more graphical view of my time,
 sync with my PDA, and coordinate my schedule with other people. Those
 applications support detailed schedule entries with powerful cyclic
 options. On the other hand,
<a href="http://sachachua.com/notebook/wiki/PlannerMode">PlannerMode</a> gives me
a personal, plain
 text view and (at least the way I use it) requires me to edit a
 separate file to add new appointments. However, it does have one
 advantage &#x2013; my schedule is always loaded. I used to use Outlook on
 Windows, but having my schedule in a separate application meant that I
 actually looked at it very rarely, as I had turned off reminders
 because they got annoying.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://sachachua.com/notebook/wiki/PlannerMode">PlannerMode</a>‘s notes,
however, are what really convinced me. I can hit
 a keyboard shortcut from anywhere and type my notes into a buffer
 which automatically keeps context information. After typing the note,
 I can then categorize it. I think that the critical thing here is that
 interruptions&#x2014;fleeting thoughts&#x2014;don't break my flow. I can just pop
 up a remember buffer, stow that thought away somewhere, and go back to
 it whenever I want. In contrast, creating a note in Outlook means
 switching out of my application, making a couple of keystrokes, typing
 the note in, and then switching back. The context switches make it
 hard to keep track of where I am and what I'm supposed to remember.
 Not only that, I need to enter context by hand. Even though I can
 color my notes and reorganize them in Outlook, I find the context
 switch too expensive. I used to keep notes in other knowledge
 management tools as well. Some applications allowed me to
 drag-and-drop links into the current note, and that was cool. But
 that required a manual action, and those applications didn't feel
 integrated into my way of working.
</p>

<p>
I guess that's why I like
<a href="http://sachachua.com/notebook/wiki/PlannerMode">PlannerMode</a>. Unlike
other organizers which
 don't know anything about the applications I use,
<a href="http://sachachua.com/notebook/wiki/PlannerMode">PlannerMode</a> tries
 its best to integrate into the way I work, and it's easy to extend.
 Fortunately I do almost all my work in Emacs, so I can think of my
 organizer as integrated into my e-mail client, Internet Relay Chat
 client, web browser, file editor and even games. It automatically
 picks up context clues from these applications and allows me to easily
 jump back to relevant files. It doesn't distract me. It allows me to
 key in data and then it gets out of my way.
</p>

<p>
The processing that happens in the background (publish to RSS and PHP
 for me) is a bonus, and publishing my task list and notes online has
 greatly helped me. It gives other people a way to see what I'm working
 on and what I've planned for the future. Occasionally people write in
 with additional resources and helpful tips.
</p>

<p>
This made me wonder how to integrate it with more applications and
 make it available to more people. Yes, even the vi users and the
 non-Linux/Un*x geeks. Here are some of the thoughts that went through
 my head.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>What if everyone could have the equivalent of M-x remember even if
</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>
they're not using Emacs?
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>What if we could capture context from any application?
</li>

<li>What if remembered thoughts could have multiple categories and
</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>
could be reorganized later?
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>What if we could use statistical methods to suggest categories for
</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>
text and find related items?
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>What if whenever you interacted with the system, related notes would
</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>
show up? When you open a file, browse a page or look at a contact, a
 sidebar could allow you to quickly jump to related topics.
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>What if you could visualize your remembered thoughts to see how
</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>
they cluster around certain topics?
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>What if you could perform powerful search operations on
</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>
remembered thoughts?
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>What if it could pick up even more context clues, tying together
</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>
different applications? For example, if you do your e-mail in Eudora
 but keep your main contact information in Outlook, wouldn't it be
 nice if remembering from an e-mail also linked in the business card
 from Outlook?
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>What if we could select some of these remembered thoughts and
</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>
publish them in different formats, automatically or manually?
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>What if we could share our stream of remembered thoughts with other
</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>
people?
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>What if computers could generate remembered thoughts as well, and
</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>
we could select which ones we'd like to include in our streams?
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The more I think about it, the more I feel that this is worth studying
 further. If we develop this idea, other people can benefit from it -
 not just those who incidentally use it in the course of using
 <a href="http://sachachua.com/notebook/wiki/PlannerMode">PlannerMode</a>! John
Wiegley was onto something good here, and it'd be a
 shame to keep it only within a niche community. I'd like to make it
 easy for my mom to use this. =)
</p>

<p>
For my MS degree, I want to develop a framework for remembering
 thoughts from different applications. This means separating the
 front-end, the back-end, and the context gathering functions. Right
 now, everything is within Emacs. I'd like to split it up so that
 people using windowing environments like GNOME or KDE can get a nice
 dialog box if they want and people using other editors on the console
 can use their favorite editor to add notes. I'd like to split the
 backend up so that people can remember to SQL databases, plain text
 files, mail&#x2014;anything and everything. I'd like to split the context
 gathering up so that application developers can easily hook into the
 system.
</p>

<p>
For my PhD, I want to look into managing all of this information.
 How do I find relevant documents now that I'll be capturing
 vastly more information? How can I make browsing my personal data
 store easier? How does it change my work style? Can I think of
 interacting with my computer&#x2014;working on e-mail, writing documents,
 etc.&#x2014;as interacting with a stream of remembered thoughts? Can it be
 my primary interface? If we shared our remembered thoughts with other
 people, how would that affect the way we work?
