</p>

<p>
I needed to update many of the links in our wiki because a team member
left, so I had to reupload all of her files to a shared service and
change all the URLs to point to the new files. Unfortunately, the file
service didn't send me the former URLs of the files, so that was going
to be a manual process. Our wiki had 149 pages in it. Not fun.
</p>

<p>
After a few pages of editing (and correcting the occasional typo that
crept in as I changed URLs), I decided to partially automate the
process. Using a smidgen of Emacs Lisp, I created a function that pasted
text into a temporary buffer, performed whatever automatic fixes it
could make, prompted me for any URLs it didn't recognize, remembered the
old URL &#x2013; new URL mapping I defined, and copied the text back.
</p>

<p>
The function looked somewhat like this:
</p>

<pre class="example">
(defvar sacha/wiki-links nil "Associative list of (old-url . new-url).")
(defun sacha/wiki-fix ()
  (interactive)
  (with-temp-buffer
    ;; Insert text from clipboard
    (yank)
    (goto-char (point-min))
    ;; Look for all the links 
    (while (re-search-forward
            "\\[\\([^|]+\\)|\\([^\]]+\\)\\]" nil t)
      ;; Check if it's one of the links I want to replace
      (if (or (string-match-p "viewpage" (match-string 2))
              (string-match-p "lsoohoo" (match-string 2)))
          (replace-match
           (save-match-data
             ;; Prompt and the entry to the map if it does not yet exist
             (unless (assoc (match-string 2) sacha/wiki-links)
               (add-to-list 'sacha/wiki-links
                            (cons (match-string 2)
                                  (read-string (concat (match-string 1)
                                                       "? ")))))
             ;; pick up the corresponding URL
             (cdr (assoc (match-string 2) sacha/wiki-links)))
           t t nil 2)))
    ;; Copy the text into the clipboard
    (kill-new (buffer-string))))
</pre>

<p>
I used <code>M-x global-set-key</code> to bind a convenient function key to it
(F12, I think), and then it was just a matter of clicking on each page,
clicking on Edit, typing Ctrl-C to copy the text, switching to Emacs,
pressing F12, switching back to my browser, typing Ctrl-V, and saving
the wiki page. I also added some lines (not shown here) to convert the
previous wiki gardener's full links to intrawiki links, change server
URLs, and do other fun things.
</p>

<p>
I thought about fully automating it (somehow hooking into w3, perhaps?),
but that seemed to be more trouble than needed. Besides, it was good to
review all the pages.
</p>

<p>
As a result of this Emacs wizardry, processing all 149 wiki pages took
me a few hours instead of a few days. Yay!
</p>

<p>
Of course, I finished the last wiki page, I found out that I needed to
change the servers in the URL. I decided to go ahead and fully automate
the darn thing.
</p>

<p>
I extracted a list of URLs for the wiki by viewing the tree version of
the wiki index. It used Javascript, so I couldn't just pull the URLs out
of the source code. Fortunately, the Firebug plugin for Firefox lets me
copy the rendered HTML, so I used that instead. Some judicious
text-editing later (<code>replace-regexp</code> rocks), I had a list of URLs to the
different pages. I knew I needed to put in some kind of delay when
loading web pages. <code>sleep-for</code> let me spread out my requests so I didn't
hammer the server too badly. Reading the w3m.el source code turned up
<code>w3m-async-exec</code>. Once I set that to nil, requesting web pages and
running code on the results turned out to be straightforward. Selecting
the right widgets was a bit of a hack (<code>re-search-forward</code> here,
<code>w3m-previous-anchor</code> there), but hey, it worked. After confirming it by
manually running it on a few pages, I left it merrily running in the
background.
</p>

<p>
Here it is (some tweaking required):
</p>

<pre class="example">
(defun sacha/edit-wiki-page ()
  (interactive)
  (let ((buffer (current-buffer))
        (w3m-async-exec nil)
        (delay 5)) ;; number of seconds
    ;; While not at the end of the buffer
    (while (not (eobp))
      ;; Load the URL on the current line
      (w3m-browse-url
       (buffer-substring
        (line-beginning-position)
        (line-end-position)))
      ;; Look for the edit button
      (goto-char (point-min))
      (when (search-forward "Edit" nil t)
        ;; Click it
        (w3m-view-this-url)
        ;; Look for the Minor change checkbox
        (goto-char (point-min))
        (when (search-forward "Minor change" nil t)
          ;; The text area is the second widget back
          (w3m-previous-anchor 2)
          ;; Open the text area in a temporary buffer for editing
          (w3m-view-this-url)
          ;; Do the changes
          (while (re-search-forward "https?://example.com/path" nil t)
            (replace-match "http://path.example.com" t t nil 0))
          ;; Save the value
          (w3m-form-input-textarea-set)
          (when (search-backward "Save" nil t)
            (w3m-view-this-url))))
      (switch-to-buffer buffer)
      (forward-line)
      (sleep-for delay))))
</pre>

<p>
I'm sure this kind of automation might be possible with lots of hacking
in Mozilla Firefox, and I've seen great scripts for the Mac, too. But I
know Emacs, I'm comfortable digging into source code, and I can make
things work.
</p>

<p>
Awesome. =D
