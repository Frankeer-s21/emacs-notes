<p>
By golly, it's starting to look like a book.
</p>

<p>
I just finished putting together my third chapter, which is really
chapter 7 in the book: managing your notes and Emacs. This chapter is
about taking notes in Emacs, focusing on Remember, Org, Planner, and
blogs. At 38 pages, it's a little over my planned 35 pages, and I
haven't even covered all the things that I wanted to like random
information management with Howm, blogging to Blosxom, and customizing
Planner templates. Maybe after some really fierce copy-editing, I'll
have some space.
</p>

<p>
I sent a copy off to my editor, and I just finished uploading a
<a href="http://sachachua.com/notebook/wickedcoolemacs/wc-emacs-07-managing-your-notes.pdf">PDF</a>
and
<a href="http://sachachua.com/notebook/wickedcoolemacs/wc-emacs-07-managing-your-notes.doc">OpenOffice.org
document</a> that you can download and read. There's also an
<a href="http://sachachua.com/notebook/wickedcoolemacs/wc-emacs-07-managing-your-notes.html">HTML
version</a>, but the formatting is a little wonky. I hope you find this
useful! I didn't blog as much of this as I did last time, so I missed
out on all the wonderful feedback people could've given me. I'll do that
next chapter.
</p>

<p>
I formatted most of the chapter this afternoon, hanging out with Leigh
Honeywell, Seth Hardy, and a few other geeks at the Linux Caffe. Leigh's
working on a book proposal, and we're thinking of organizing a writing
group for technical authors. We'll start by meeting this Thursday at
Leigh's apartment. iI enjoyed chatting with them as I worked on my book,
drifting in and out of conversations. I think it would be a good idea to
work somewhere quieter, with plenty of table room for assorted gadgets,
but this was a good start.
</p>

<p>
Next chapter: contact management in Emacs. I've got a lot of fun hacks
that I want to share here, so coming up with material shouldn't be hard.
I'll keep you posted!
