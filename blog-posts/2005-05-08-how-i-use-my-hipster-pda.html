<h1 class="title">How I use my Hipster PDA</h1>

</p>

<p>
After all my experiments with
<a href="http://sachachua.com/notebook/wiki/WearableComputing">wearable
computing</a>
 using a <a href="http://www.handykey.com">one-handed chording keyboard</a> and a
<a href="http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/flite/">speech synthesizer</a>,
 I've found that the most portable device for me is still a 3×5 pack of
index cards bound with a fold-back clip.
 Jokingly dubbed the “Hipster PDA” elsewhere on the Net, this low-tech
device is surprisingly flexible and easy to use.
 I use mine to keep track of tasks and random notes for later entry into
my online planner.
</p>

<p>
My Hipster PDA is composed of:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>a colored index card with my contact information
</li>
<li>my inbox: cards with notes on them that haven't been entered into the
computer
</li>
<li>two pages of month templates from a 3×5 day planner
</li>
<li>a year calendar for 2005 and 2006
</li>
<li>my archive: index cards that have already been entered but might
still be useful
</li>
<li>a colored index card with yellow sticky notes
</li>
<li>a stack of blank index cards
</li>
<li>a fold-back clip holding all of these things together
</li>
<li>a black signpen or a mechanical pencil tucked into the fold-back clip
</li>
</ul>

<p>
One of the things I've found much easier to do with my 3×5 pack of
 cards than with a PDA or a Franklin-Covey planner is to keep track of
 get-togethers. When my friends and I schedule our next get-together, I
 lay the month templates out so that I can see the next 30 days at a
 glance. This is difficult to do with a PDA because PDA screens are
 small. A Franklin-Covey planner would probably be more organized, but
 I like being able to lay things out side-by-side instead of flipping
 through pages.
</p>

<p>
When I need to jot something down, I flip the deck and write on the
 last card. After I finish one side of the card, I turn it over, clip
 it, and write on the other side. When the whole card is full, I move
 it into my inbox.
</p>

<p>
Index cards are handy because it's easy to give information away to
 other people. Paper gets crumpled and business cards can disappear
 into the chaos of a purse or a bag. An index card is big and bright.
 I'm thinking of replacing half of my white cards with brightly-colored
 cards so that people can easily find information I give them.
</p>

<p>
I'm planning to do other things with my pack of 3×5 index cards. For
 example, I can write my projects on the cards. Reviewing these cards
 will reinforce these goals in my mind and remind me to keep making
 progress.
</p>

<p>
Index cards totally rock.

The new computer is ten times as fast as the old one.
