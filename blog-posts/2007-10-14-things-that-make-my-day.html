This note from Mark A. Hershberger:
<a href="http://hexmode.com/487848.html"><a href="http://hexmode.com/487848.html">http://hexmode.com/487848.html</a></a> ,
 and all the rest of the e-mail I've been getting from Emacs geeks&#x2026;
<b>glow!</b>
</p>

<p>
Now even just <b>thinking</b> about the book makes me feel all warm and
 fuzzy and eager to write. Who knows what cool hacks I'll come across
 in the process? How wonderful can it be? =)
</p>

<p>
I promise to finish the raw text for the first chapter (planning your
 day in Emacs) by this week, and I'll get plain-text or formatted
 drafts out to beta reviewers by next week. I can't wait to see how
 much better it will be once other people get their hands on it.
 Questions, clarifications, cool hacks, cheers&#x2026; It'll be so much fun!
</p>

<p>
I've always liked working on things that real people used. That was
 one of the biggest reasons I <b>loved</b> maintaining Planner: hearing from
 people how it helped them do something cool or made their day or helped
them make someone else's day&#x2026; I love making people
 happy, and I'm looking forward to doing that with this book. =) To all
 the people who've written or who'll write to me in the future&#x2014;thank
you for
 stepping forward and letting me see <b>you</b> instead of just a nameless,
faceless audience. Thank you for letting me write for you!
