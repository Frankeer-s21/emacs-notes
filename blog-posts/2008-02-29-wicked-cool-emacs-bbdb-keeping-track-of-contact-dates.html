<p>
I hadn't realized just how much I missed my Big Brother Database until
today. Three networking events packed into one week meant that I hadn't
set aside enough time for follow up, and I felt my memories of the
conversations getting a little hazy. Fortunately I'd taken some notes on
my Palm, but I knew I had to get it into some kind of contact management
system quickly, and Gmail Contacts just wasn't compelling enough for me.
So it's back to Emacs, plain text files, and a surprisingly
sophisticated contact manager.
</p>

<p>
I also promised to do some work on the book today, so everything
dovetailed nicely.
</p>

<p>
The following bit of code helps me filter displayed contacts to show
only the people I haven't contacted since a certain date. This is handy
for remembering to keep in touch with old friends, for example. Or at
least it would be handy if I used it more often and if I actually sent
the letters that pile up in my e-mail drafts and my snail mail outbox&#x2026;
but at least it's a step in the right direction.
</p>

<p>
If you want to know who you have or haven't talked to in a while, you
need to do two things. First, you need to keep track of when you talked
to people. Second, you need to generate reports.
</p>

<p>
To be able to quickly add contact notes to BBDB records, add the
following to your <i>~</i>.emacs/:
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1">ch6-bbdb-ping.el:</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<pre class="example">
(define-key bbdb-mode-map "z" 'wicked/bbdb-ping-bbdb-record)
(defun wicked/bbdb-ping-bbdb-record (bbdb-record text &amp;optional date regrind)
  "Adds a note for today to the current BBDB record.
Call with a prefix to specify date.
BBDB-RECORD is the record to modify (default: current).
TEXT is the note to add for DATE.
If REGRIND is non-nil, redisplay the BBDB record."
  (interactive (list (bbdb-current-record t)
                     (read-string "Notes: ")
                     ;; Reading date - more powerful with Planner, but we'll make do if necessary
                     (if (featurep 'planner)
                         (if current-prefix-arg (planner-read-date) (planner-today))
                       (if current-prefix-arg
                           (read-string "Date (YYYY.MM.DD): ")
                         (format-time-string "%Y.%m.%d")))
                     t))
  (bbdb-record-putprop bbdb-record
                       'contact
                       (concat date ": " text "\n"
                               (or (bbdb-record-getprop bbdb-record 'contact))))
  (if regrind
      (save-excursion
        (set-buffer bbdb-buffer-name)
        (bbdb-redisplay-one-record bbdb-record)))
  nil)
</pre>

<p>
You can then use z in BBDB buffers to add a quick note to the “contact”
field of the current record. The date is automatically noted. You can
create a note for a specific date by calling {{C-u
wicked/bbdb-ping-bbdb-record}} with a prefix argument. For convenience,
the suggested configuration binds this to “z”, because it was one of the
few unbound keys I could find. Use this after you meet, call, or e-mail
people, and write down a short note about the conversation you had. You
might find these notes useful later on.
</p>

<p>
If you met a number of people at an event in the past and you have
Planner installed and loaded, you can use {{planner-timewarp}} to set
the effective date to another date. To return to today, use {{M-x
planner-timewarp nil}}.
</p>

<p>
To automatically add a datestamped copy of sent e-mail subjects to
people's BBDB records, add the following to your <i>~</i>.gnus/:
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2">ch6-bbdb-message-add-subject.el:</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<pre class="example">
(defun wicked/message-add-subject-to-bbdb-record ()
  "Add datestamped subject note for each person this message has been sent to."
  (let* ((subject (concat (format-time-string "%Y.%m.%d")
                          ": E-mail: " (message-fetch-field "Subject") "\n"))
         (bbdb-get-addresses-headers
          (list (assoc 'recipients bbdb-get-addresses-headers)))
         records)
    (setq records
          (bbdb-update-records
           (bbdb-get-addresses nil gnus-ignored-from-addresses 'gnus-fetch-field)
           nil nil))
    (mapc (lambda (rec)
            (bbdb-record-putprop rec
                                 'contact
                                 (concat subject
                                         (or
                                          (bbdb-record-getprop rec 'contact)
                                          ""))))
          records)))
(add-hook 'message-send-hook 'wicked/message-add-subject-to-bbdb-record)
</pre>

<p>
Now that you have the data, how can you use it to filter? Add the
following to your <i>~</i>.emacs/:
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3">ch6-bbdb-show-only-no-contact-since.el:</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<pre class="example">
(defun wicked/bbdb-show-only-no-contact-since (date &amp;optional reverse records)
  "Show only people who haven't been pinged since DATE or at all.
If REVERSE is non-nil, show only the people you've contacted on or since DATE.
Call with a prefix argument to show only people you've contacted on or since DATE."
  (interactive (list
                (if (featurep 'planner)
                    (planner-read-date)
                  (read-string "Date (YYYY.MM.DD): "))
                current-prefix-arg (or bbdb-records (bbdb-records))))
  (let (new-records
        last-match
        timestamp
        omit
        notes)
    (while records
      ;; Find the latest date mentioned in the entry
      (let ((timestamp (wicked/bbdb-last-date
                        (if (vectorp (car records))
                            (car records)
                          (caar records)))))
        (if (if reverse
                ;; Keep if contact is &gt;= date
                (null (string&lt; timestamp date))
              ;; Keep if date &gt; contact
              (string&gt; date timestamp))
            (add-to-list 'new-records (if (vectorp (car records))
                            (car records)
                          (caar records)) t)))
      (setq records (cdr records)))
    (bbdb-display-records new-records)))

(defun wicked/bbdb-last-date (rec)
  "Return the most recent date for REC or nil if none.
Dates should be in the form YYYY.MM.DD.  The first date in the
notes field and the first date in the contact field are used, so
dates should be in reverse chronological order."
  (let* ((wicked/date-regexp
          "\\&lt;\\([1-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]\\)\\.\\([0-9][0-9]?\\)\\.\\([0-9][0-9]?\\)\\&gt;")
         ;; Get the first date mentioned in the notes field
         (notes-date
          (or (and (string-match wicked/date-regexp (or (bbdb-record-notes rec) ""))
                   (match-string 0 (or (bbdb-record-notes rec) "")))
              "0000.00.00"))
         ;; Get the first date mentioned in the contact field
         (contact-date
          (or (and (string-match wicked/date-regexp (or (bbdb-record-getprop rec 'contact) ""))
                   (match-string 0 (or (bbdb-record-getprop rec 'contact) "")))
              "0000.00.00")))
    ;; Compare the two dates
    (or (if (string&lt; notes-date contact-date) contact-date notes-date)
        "0000.00.00")))
</pre>

<p>
To generate a report, use {{M-x wicked/bbdb-show-only-no-contact-since}}
and specify the date. These functions are much easier to use with
Planner's date-handling functions. Planner can read dates like “-1″
(yesterday), “-7fri” (seven Fridays ago), “2″ (the second of this
month), “1.2″ (January 2 in this year), and “2007.01.02″ (January 2,
2007).
</p>

<p>
You can also flip the filter by using the universal prefix argument
({{C-u M-x wicked/bbdb-show-only-no-contact-since}}) to show only the
people you've contacted since a certain date. This is good for knowing
the size of your active network. Because the filter works on displayed
records, you can combine it to find all the people you talked to last
year but not this year. You can also combine it with other filters to
find all the people you've marked as friends, but who you haven't talked
to in three months. Then you can send a personalized e-mail or make a
phone list, and get back in touch. And that's how you keep track of your
contact dates!
