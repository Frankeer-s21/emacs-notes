</p>

<p>
You'd like to use the Org Mode for Emacs to manage your tasks. In this
 blog post, I'll cover the absolute minimum you need to get started.
 We'll assume that you already have GNU Emacs 22 and that you're
reasonably
 familiar with using Emacs, including installing external modules and
 adding them to your load path.
</p>

<p>
There are a million ways to plan, but we're going to focus on two. The
 first approach is Getting Things Done (GTD), described by David Allen
 in the book of the same title. GTD focuses on next actions (the very
 next thing you can do) and uses context lists to keep things
 manageable. Popular ways to do GTD are with index cards, recycled
 business cards, or software programs. If most of your tasks are in
 your head or scattered on scraps of paper, GTD will probably give you
 the most organizational bang for the least effort.
</p>

<p>
The second approach is day planning. You plan your week based on your
 projects and priorities, write your tasks onto the pages for each day,
 and copy unfinished tasks over to the next day. If you've used one of
 those Filofax, Franklin-Covey or Dayrunner personal organizers, you're
 probably used to this way of planning.
</p>

<p>
As you learn more about Emacs and task management, you'll probably
 develop your own way of doing things. These two are a good place to
 start, though. (Don't recognize how you plan your day, but
 interested in using Emacs anyway? Please get in touch with me! I may
 know of something that fits, and I'd certainly love to hear about the
 way you work.)
</p>

<p>
If you use GTD, read on. Otherwise, read the Setup and then wait for
 the next blog post! =)
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1">Set up</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
Org is part of Emacs 22. To make it even easier to collect tasks and
 notes, install a separate package called Remember.
</p>

<p>
First, download and unpack Remember. As of this writing, Remember is
 at version 1.9. You can get the TAR.GZ from
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://download.gna.org/remember-el/remember-1.9.tar.gz"><a href="http://download.gna.org/remember-el/remember-1.9.tar.gz605">http://download.gna.org/remember-el/remember-1.9.tar.gz605</a></a>
or the ZIP
 archive from
<a href="http://download.gna.org/remember-el/remember-1.9.zip"><a href="http://download.gna.org/remember-el/remember-1.9.zip606">http://download.gna.org/remember-el/remember-1.9.zip606</a></a>
. If
 these instructions are out of date, check
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/RememberMode"><a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/RememberMode607">http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/RememberMode607</a></a>
to find out where to get Remember.
</p>

<p>
Then add this basic configuration for Org and Remember to your ~/.emacs,
</p>

<pre class="example">
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/elisp/remember-1.9")                                  ;; (1)
(require 'remember-autoloads)
(setq org-remember-templates
   '(("Tasks" ?t "* TODO %?\n  %i\n  %a" "~/organizer.org")                      ;; (2)
     ("Appointments" ?a "* Appointment: %?\n%^T\n%i\n  %a" "~/organizer.org")))
(setq remember-annotation-functions '(org-remember-annotation))
(setq remember-handler-functions '(org-remember-handler))
(eval-after-load 'remember
  '(add-hook 'remember-mode-hook 'org-remember-apply-template))
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c r") 'remember)                                         ;; (3)

(require 'org)
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.org$" . org-mode))                           ;; (4)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c a") 'org-agenda)                                       ;; (5)
(setq org-todo-keywords '("TODO" "STARTED" "WAITING" "DONE"))                    ;; (6)
(setq org-agenda-include-diary t)                                                ;; (7)
(setq org-agenda-include-all-todo t)                                             ;; (8)
</pre>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>(1): Change the directory as necessary.
</li>
<li>(2): You can use a different filename.
</li>
<li>(3): You can change this keyboard shortcut.
</li>
<li>(4): This tells Emacs to open all .org files in org-mode.
</li>
<li>(5): You can change this keyboard shortcut.
</li>
<li>(6): This makes it easy to pull in holidays and other events. See the
chapter on managing your schedule.
</li>
<li>(7): This includes all unfinished todos in the Org daily and weekly
views. You can remove this line when you get used to working with
todo lists.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
After you evaluate that code by calling M-x eval-buffer or restarting
Emacs, you're ready to create an Org file.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Open ~/organizer.org (or whichever file you specified in (2)).
</li>
<li>Save it. This is probably the only time you'll have an empty TODO
list.
</li>
<li>Use C-c [ (org-agenda-file-to-front) to add it to your
org-agenda-files. You only need to do this once for this agenda file.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Read on to find out how to use your new Org file for GTD, or skip ahead
to the section on Day Planning to find out how to plan by day!

So you've read David Allen's book about Getting Things Done (or any of
 the countless summaries of it on the Net), and you'd like to get
 started with Emacs and Org mode. I'll show you the bare minimum you
 need to support the five phases in the GTD task workflow:

<div id="outline-container-sec-2-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-1">Collect</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">
<p>
The first thing you need to do is get all the tasks out of your head,
 off scraps of paper, out of your e-mail, and so on. If this is the
 first time you're putting tasks into Org, you have a lot of tasks to
 collect. The best way to collect lots of tasks is to open your Org
 agenda file (~/organizer.org) and put this heading at the end of the
 file:
</p>

<pre class="example">
* Inbox
</pre>

<p>
Now go to the end of the file, and type in ** TODO and the first task
 you can think of, like this:
</p>

<pre class="example">
** TODO Buy milk
</pre>

<p>
Press C-M-RET and keep typing other tasks. Keep going until you've
 gone through all the things in your head and all the scraps of paper
 lying around. Do not get distracted. Your goal is to write all the
 tasks down. If you are as easily distracted as I am, do not even open
 up a browser window or look at your e-mail. It can be a real struggle
 sometimes to focus long enough to get everything down, especially when
 you're writing down all these tasks that you can work on. DO NOT DO A
 TASK UNLESS IT TAKES LESS THAN TWO MINUTES TO DO. In fact, if you are
 just starting out with GTD, you might find it better to resist all
 temptations to do tasks during this step. Get it all out.
</p>

<p>
Now that you've gotten your tasks out of your head and into your
 organizer.org file, breathe. There's less stress in your brain now,
 because you don't have to worry about forgetting things (as long as
 you remember to check your Org file, that is!).
</p>

<p>
DO NOT FILL YOUR BRAIN BACK UP WITH OTHER THINGS TO DO. The brain is a
 wonderful thing, but it's not good at remembering what you need to do.
 Whenever a task comes your wayâ€”through e-mail, in conversation, in
 the showerâ€”put it in your ~/organizer.org. Well, you probably don't
 want to drip all over the computer, so sometimes you'll need to hang
 on to an ideaâ€”but get it out of your head and into your organizer as
 quickly as possible.
</p>

<p>
To collect tasks within Emacs as they come up, use Remember. With the
 basic configuration you set up in the previous section, you can use
 C-c r t (or M-x remember and “t” for the Tasks template) to pop up a
 buffer where you can type in the task description and some notes.
</p>

<pre class="example">
## Filing location: Select interactively, default, or last used:
##     C-u C-c C-c  to select file and header location interactively.
##         C-c C-c  "~/notebook/personal/organizer.org" -&gt; "* Tasks"
## C-u C-u C-c C-c  "???" -&gt; "* ???"
## To switch templates, use `M-x org-remember'.

* TODO
</pre>

<p>
And if you're lucky, there will even be a hyperlink to the file or
 e-mail you were looking at when you called C-c r t (remember, tasks).
</p>

<p>
If you brain-dump your tasks and use C-c r t to collect tasks as they
 come up, you can free up your brain for other things, such as
 contemplating the meaning of life.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-2">Process</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">
<p>
Now that you've collected all those tasks into your inbox, you can
 process them. Open your Org agenda file and go to your inbox.
</p>

<p>
For every item there, decide if it's something that you need to act
 on. Is it really just a note? If so, take out the TODO keyword and
 organize it like you would store other notes. If it's a true-blue
 task, decide if it's something you can do within the next two minutes,
 delegate to someone else, or leave on your task list. Go through your
 list systematically, delegating and eliminating whenever possible.
</p>

<p>
If you delegate the task, change it to WAITING by moving your cursor
 to the headline with the TODO keyword and typing S-r (org-shiftright)
 until it changes to WAITING. To keep track of who you delegated it to,
 just edit the task description to reflect it. Your organizer file will
 look like this:
</p>

<pre class="example">
** WAITING Buy milk - WJY
</pre>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-3">Organize</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-3">
<p>
You have a list of tasks that \<sub>you\</sub>_ need to act on. If you've
 braindumped everything that people have asked you to do and that
 you've thought of doing, this is probably a very long list.
 Intimidatingly long. The next step in restoring sanity to your life is
 to organize your list into next actions, projects, things you're
 waiting for, and someday/maybe tasks.
</p>

<p>
Review that task list. For each task, decide if it's something you can
 do immediately. Is it something you can do in one sitting, and do you
 have everything you need in order to do it? If so, great! It's a next
 action. Leave it on your task list.
</p>

<p>
If you can't immediately work on a task, it may be a project in
 disguise, and it needs to be broken down into smaller, concrete next
 actions. For example, the task:
</p>

<pre class="example">
** TODO Write a book about Emacs
</pre>

<p>
would probably result in me getting complete writer's block. If you're
 faced with a big task like this, move it out of your inbox and make it
 a project. Then you can think of the very next action you need to do.
 Your Org file could look something like this:
</p>

<pre class="example">
* Projects

** Emacs book
*** TODO Write about basic Org and GTD

* Inbox

** TODO ... lots of other things go here ...
** TODO ... lots of other things go here ...
** TODO ... lots of other things go here ...
</pre>

<p>
A task might also be stuck because you need to wait for someone else.
 For example, I'm currently working on renewing my visa, but I need to
 wait for the embassy. Mark those stuck tasks as WAITING with S-right
 (org-shiftright).
</p>

<p>
Someday/maybe tasks are nice to think about once in a while, but you
 don't want to clutter your day-to-day tasks with them. A basic way to
 deal with this is to move those tasks into a separate Organizer file
 such as ~/someday.org . Another is to use tags, which we'll cover in
 the section on intermediate Org. For now, just move them to another
 file.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2-4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-4">Review</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-4">
<p>
You've gone from a whole bunch of tasks in your brain and on pieces of
 paper to one text file containing everything you need to do, with an
 easy way to get to just the things you can do right now. To view all
 your tasks, type C-c a t (org-agenda, tasks). You'll get something
 that looks like this:
</p>

<pre class="example">
Global list of TODO items of type: ALL
Available with `N r': (0)ALL (1)TODO (2)STARTED (3)WAITING (4)DONE
TODO Write about basic Org and GTD
TODO Blog
TODO Answer my mail
TODO Alter slacks
...
</pre>

<p>
Type “1 r” to show only the active tasks, and review what you're
 waiting for with “3 r”. Review this WAITING list every so often
 to make sure that nothing falls through the cracks.
</p>

<p>
Type “f” to start follow mode, which displays the relevant lines from
 your Org agenda file as you move around. This is helpful for quickly
 reviewing your task list.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2-5" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-5">Do</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-5">
<p>
All of the above should take you less than fifteen minutes of planning
 each day. The rest of the time, you can focus on doing the work,
 undistracted by shiny new tasks that pop up because you can get them
 out of your way with C-c r t.
</p>

<p>
To work, review your task list with either C-c a t (org-agenda, tasks)
 or C-a a (org-agenda, agenda). From the agenda view, type “t”
 (org-agenda-todo) to change the task status. I find it helpful to mark
 a task as STARTED because it helps me remember what I was working on
 in case I get distracted by something urgent, but you can also use C-u
 t to jump to a status without cycling through the ones in between
 (say, marking a task as DONE). You can also press ENTER to jump to the
 task headline and edit it directly.
</p>

<p>
Going back to reviews: As you mark tasks done, you'll also want to do
 daily and weekly reviews. You can see those with C-c a a (org-agenda,
 org-agenda-list), which opens an Org agenda view. To see completed
 tasks in the Org agenda view, type l (org-agenda-log-mode). To switch
 to the day view, type d (org-agenda-day-view). To switch to the week
 view, type w (org-agenda-week-view). The basic configuration I've
 suggested here will automatically include unfinished tasks at the
 beginning of the agenda. Scroll up to review your tasks, and press
 ENTER on a line to jump to it.

There's a lot more you can do with Org to make it support GTD, but
 here's a basic configuration that can get you started on collecting,
 processing, organizing, managing, and actually doing your tasks. Stay

 repeated tasks, clocking time, working with projects, and tagging
 tasks!
