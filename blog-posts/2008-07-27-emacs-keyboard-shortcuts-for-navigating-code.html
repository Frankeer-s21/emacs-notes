UPDATE 2014-01-21: Add regexp-quote around current-word.
</p>

<p>
One of the lines on my list of things I can do in order to make progress
on my book is to move my Drupal development environment from Eclipse to
Emacs, as immersion would no doubt give me plenty of things to tweak and
describe. When you use something every day, you notice the rough edges.
With Emacs, you can sand those edges down. I already use Emacs every
day, but I had been doing most of my development work in Eclipse because
Eclipse packaged a number of useful features I wanted. If I can move my
environment to Emacs, though, I'll be able to customize it a lot more
freely.
</p>

<p>
Take something as simple as navigation, for example. In Eclipse, I can
hit Ctrl+K to search for the next instance of the current word, which is
a handy way to look for function calls or definitions in the same file.
How would you do that in Emacs? The built-in search functions allow me
to take text from the buffer, but I wanted something even faster. Here
are some of the ways you can tweak navigation, too.
</p>

<p>
If you haven't tried it yet, you'll probably like interactive search
(C-s) because you can modify the search and see the results as you type.
All you need to do to make it better than Eclipse's Ctrl+K is to add a
function to grab the current word, even if the point in the middle of
the word. Add the following code to your ~/.emacs:
</p>

<pre class="example">
(defun sacha/isearch-yank-current-word ()
  "Pull current word from buffer into search string."
  (interactive)
  (save-excursion
    (skip-syntax-backward "w_")
    (isearch-yank-internal
     (lambda ()
       (skip-syntax-forward "w_")
       (point)))))
(define-key isearch-mode-map (kbd "C-x") 'sacha/isearch-yank-current-word)
</pre>

<p>
Type C-s (isearch-forward) to start interactively searching forward, and
type C-x to get the current word. Use C-s and C-r to search forward and
backward. You can modify your search, too.
</p>

<p>
Want to make it even faster? Use these functions to bind similar
searches to shortcut keys:
</p>

<pre class="example">
(defun sacha/search-word-backward ()
  "Find the previous occurrence of the current word."
  (interactive)
  (let ((cur (point)))
    (skip-syntax-backward "w_")
    (goto-char
     (if (re-search-backward (concat "\\_&lt;" (regexp-quote (current-word)) "\\_&gt;") nil t)
     (match-beginning 0)
       cur))))

(defun sacha/search-word-forward ()
  "Find the next occurrance of the current word."
  (interactive)
  (let ((cur (point)))
    (skip-syntax-forward "w_")
    (goto-char
     (if (re-search-forward (concat "\\_&lt;" (regexp-quote (current-word)) "\\_&gt;") nil t)
     (match-beginning 0)
       cur))))
(global-set-key '[M-up] 'sacha/search-word-backward)
(global-set-key '[M-down] 'sacha/search-word-forward)
</pre>

<p>
Feel free to change the keybindings or otherwise improve the code. =)
Good luck and have fun!
