<h1 class="title">Planner for Eclipse?</h1>
<p>
September 9th, 2005 -
<a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/p/2971"><a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/p/2971">http://sachachua.com/blog/p/2971</a></a>
</p>

<p>
One of the things I really love about
<a href="http://sachachua.com/notebook/wiki/PlannerMode">Planner</a> is that
 my blogging and task tracking tool is built into my working
 environment. A task or note is never more than a keystroke away.
</p>

<p>
When Stephen asked me if there was a blogging plugin for Eclipse, I
 thought: hey, there should be one. Why hasn't something like Planner
 been written for Eclipse yet? It's insanely useful. A search for
 “blog” on the Eclipse plugin page turns up nothing promising.
</p>

<p>
Right after Stephen asked me about blogging plugins, Alvin remarked
 that it was too much trouble to switch to a separate application for
 blogging. \<sub>Exactly\</sub>_ why I like Planner so much.
</p>

<p>
And exactly why a pluggable and hackable wikiblog like Planner would
 be perfect for Eclipse.
</p>

<p>
I wonder if we're on to something here. Building blogging and wiki
 tools into a development environment allows the blog/wiki engine to
 take advantage of rich metadata. We can make it easy for people to
 keep project blogs and personal knowledgebases. This would be Good
 Stuff.
</p>

<p>
And&#x2014;more challenging&#x2014;we can go beyond the line-number hyperlinking
 done by Planner. We can take advantage of Eclipse's semantic parsing
 to attach entries to pieces of code that might be refactored. How
 would that work? I don't know how to do that yet.
</p>

<p>
What do we get? A developer's notebook. This is good stuff. Time to
 find out if it's masters-level good stuff&#x2026;
