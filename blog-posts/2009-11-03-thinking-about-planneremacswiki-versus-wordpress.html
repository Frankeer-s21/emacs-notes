<h1 class="title">Thinking about Planner/EmacsWiki versus WordPress</h1>
<p>
November 3rd, 2009 -
<a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/p/6706"><a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/p/6706">http://sachachua.com/blog/p/6706</a></a>
</p>

<p>
Was it really only less than two years ago that I shifted from my
venerable
<a href="http://sachachua.com/notebook/wiki/2008.01.13.php">Planner-based
wiki/blog</a> to my <a href="http://sachachua.com/wp/">WordPress-powered one</a>
after experimenting with
<a href="http://sachachua.com/wp/2007/11/27/okay-were-in-business-5-years-of-my-life-in-wordpress/">syndicating
my entries</a> into WordPress?
</p>

<p>
I miss writing in wiki markup on Emacs and knowing that publishing would
Just Work. I miss being able to dynamically expand entries from my
address book in a way that automatically links to people's blogs. (Or
Twitter accounts, if I were going to do this now.) ScribeFire is a pain
on my Eee (needs more horizontal screen space), and I have a hard time
marking up the occasional bit of HTML in weblogger.el. Windows Live
Writer is pretty slick (particularly with the SnagIt Screen Capture
plugin and the Amazon Book Linker), but I can live without it. Or maybe
I can resurrect that WordPress Emacs client Ashish mentioned.
</p>

<p>
Let me think about the differences in experiences.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>I wanted to support comments, but I didn't want to spend a lot of
time hacking on some custom commenting system.</b> This was a big issue
for me. I found some commenting scripts, but dealing with spam was a
pain, so I switched to WordPress. If I switched back to Emacs for my
blog, I'd probably use something like <a href="http://disqus.com">Disqus</a>
to handle the conversation, and just find some way of backing up the
comments regularly.
</li>
<li><b>I wanted to make it easy to navigate posts.</b> I modified Planner to
generate a more
<a href="http://sachachua.com/notebook/wiki/WikiIndex.php">browsable blog
index</a>, but it's still not as slick as what you'd see with
WordPress. On this WordPress blog, I like offering people random blog
posts (good for me too &#x2013; great way to rediscover old posts and make
serendipitous connections!), related posts, and posts on the same
day. I can do posts on the same day in Planner with a custom hook,
but the others would require some hacking. Also, Planner is very much
day-based, while WordPress lists N posts per page and has good
category lists.
</li>
<li><b>I wanted to make it easy to edit posts.</b> In my Emacs-based system, I
published to RSS when I saved a note in the Remember window. I had a
hack that made it possible to propagate changes from an
already-published post to my WordPress blog, but it wasn't completely
reliable.
</li>
<li>*Scheduling posts is handy, too.*I hadn't gotten around to figuring
out how to build a post scheduler for Emacs. I suppose if I wasn't
picky about the time it went out, I could simply write posts on
different days and then publish notes conditionally, plus have some
kind of hook to notice if any of the current page's posts should be
published in the RSS feed, plus some way to handle previous days,
plus maybe a server-friendly way to do this for the times when I'm
not going to be online every day. Right.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
That said, I miss automatically sharing some details of what I'm working
on (with details deleted before publishing so that they're available
offline), publicly crossing off tasks, and other cool things.
</p>

<p>
Planner's model for task planning isn't quite compatible with Org's
model, and I've been using Org + Toodledo more these days.
</p>

<p>
What am I really looking for here?
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A quick, reliable way to post from a text editor, so that I can do it
from the Eee. <b>Hmm, the WP Postie plugin will probably do the trick.</b>
</li>
<li>Easy way to share/review tasks: Toodledo export of week's tasks?
</li>
<li>And maybe a custom plugin for weekly displays, org agendas, that sort
of thing.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Hmm&#x2026;.
