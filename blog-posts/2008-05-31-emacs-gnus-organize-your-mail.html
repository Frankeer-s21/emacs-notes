<p>
People handle large volumes of mail in different ways. Keeping
 everything in one mailbox can quickly become unmanageable because
 messages you need to read get lost among messages you don't need to
 read.
</p>

<p>
You can move mail manually by selecting them in the summary buffer and
 typing B m (gnus-summary-move-article). Then type the name of the
 group to which you would like to move the message. The group will be
 created if it doesn't exist.
</p>

<p>
To move multiple messages, mark them with #
 (gnus-summary-mark-as-processable) and then type B m
 (gnus-summary-move-article). To unmark a message, type M-#
 (gnus-summary-unmark-as-processable). To unmark all messages, type M P
 U (gnus-summary-unmark-all-processable).
</p>

Moving messages by hand is tedious and time-consuming. One way to deal
 with this is to set up rules that automatically file mail into
 different groups (or folders, as they're called in other mail
 clients). Gnus calls this “splitting” mail, and you can split mail on
 IMAP servers as well as mail downloaded from POP3 servers to your
 computer.
</p>

<p>
For example, if you're using Gnus to read mail from an IMAP server,
 you can split your messages by adding this to your ~/.gnus:
</p>

<pre class="example">
(setq nnimap-split-inbox "INBOX") ;; (1)
(setq nnimap-split-predicate "UNDELETED") ;; (2)
(setq nnimap-split-rule
      '(
        ("INBOX.emacs" "^Subject:.*emacs")
        ("INBOX.work" "^To:.*you@work.example.com")    
        ("INBOX.personal" "^To:.*you@personal.example.com")    
        ("INBOX.errors" "^From:.*\\(mailer.daemon\\|postmaster\\)")   
       ))
</pre>

<p>
If you use a different inbox, change the value of
 nnimap-split-inbox(1). Any messages in the inbox will be split
 according to nnimap-split-rule(2), which is a list where each element
 is a list containing the group's name and a regular expression
 matching the header of messages that should be filed in the group. In
 this example, Gnus will move mail with subjects containing the word
 “emacs” to INBOX.emacs, mail directed to you@work.example.com to the
 INBOX.work group, mail directed to you@personal.example.com to the
 INBOX.personal group, and mail error messages to INBOX.errors. All
 other messages will be stored in INBOX.
</p>

<p>
If you're downloading your mail from a POP3 server and storing it in
 nnml, add this to your ~/.gnus instead:
</p>

<pre class="example">
(setq nnmail-split-methods
     '(
       ("mail.emacs" "^Subject:.*emacs")
       ("mail.work" "^To:.*you@work.example.com")    
       ("mail.personal" "^To:.*you@personal.example.com")    
       ("mail.errors" "^From:.*\\(mailer.daemon\\|postmaster\\)")   
      ))
</pre>

<p>
All other messages will be stored in mail.misc.
</p>

<p>
Start M-x gnus again, and your mail will be split into the different
 groups.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2">Where are my groups?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
If you don't see your new groups in the group buffer displayed by M-x
 gnus, type A A (gnus-group-list-active) to see all the groups. Go to
 the group that you would like to add to the group buffer, then type u
 (gnus-group-unsubscribe-current-group) to toggle its subscription. In
 this example, INBOX.automated is not subscribed to, but INBOX is.
</p>

<pre class="example">
U    13: INBOX.automated 
     76: INBOX
</pre>

<p>
When you type M-x gnus again, you'll see your subscribed groups if
 they have unread messages.
</p>

<p>
nnimap-split-rule and nnmail-split-methods allow you to filter
 interesting or uninteresting mail into different groups based on their
 headers. Gnus comes with an even more powerful mail splitting engine.
 In fact, Gnus comes with “fancy mail splitting.”
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3">Fancy mail splitting</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
With fancy mail splitting and some configuration, you can split mail
 based on a combination of criteria. You can even manually file a
 message and have Gnus automatically file incoming replies in the same
 group.
</p>

<p>
To configure an IMAP connection to use fancy mail splitting, add the
 following to your ~/.gnus:
</p>

<pre class="example">
(setq nnimap-split-inbox "INBOX")
(setq nnimap-split-predicate "UNDELETED")
(setq nnmail-split-fancy ;; (1)
      '(|                                ;; (2)
        (: gnus-registry-split-fancy-with-parent) ;; (3)
        ;; splitting rules go here       ;; (4)
        "INBOX"                          ;; (5)
       ))
(setq nnimap-split-rule 'nnmail-split-fancy)
(setq nnmail-split-methods 'nnimap-split-fancy) ;; (6)
(gnus-registry-initialize) ;; (7)
</pre>

<p>
This configures IMAP to use the nnmail-split-fancy function to
 determine the group for messages. Note that we're setting the
 nnmail-split-fancy variable here. If you want to process your IMAP
 mail separately from your other mail, you can set the
 nnimap-split-fancy variable instead. If so, also set nnimap-split-rule
 to ‘nnimap-split-fancy. Using nnmail-split-fancy here makes the other
 examples easier to understand, though.
</p>

<p>
The nnmail-split-fancy variable controls the splitting behavior(1). The
 “|” symbol means that that the first matching rule is used(2). For
 example, if the message being processed is a reply to a message that
 Gnus knows about, then the gnus-registry-split-fancy-with-parent
 function will return the name of the group, and nnmail-split-fancy
 will file the message there(3). You can add other splitting rules as
 well(4). If messages don't match any of these rules, the last rule
 specifies that the messages will be filed in INBOX(5). Set
 nnmail-split-methods to nnimap-split-fancy as well in order to work
 around some assumptions in other parts of the code(6). After that,
 initialize the Gnus registry(7), which is responsible for tracking
 moved and deleted messages. This allows you to automatically split
 replies into the same folders as the original messages.
</p>

<p>
To configure fancy mail splitting with an nnml backend (suggested
 configuration for POP3), add the following to your ~/.gnus instead:
</p>

<pre class="example">
(gnus-registry-initialize)
(setq nnmail-split-fancy                 
      '(|                                
        (: gnus-registry-split-fancy-with-parent)
        ;; splitting rules go here       
        "mail.misc"                          ;; (1)
       ))
(setq nnmail-split-methods 'nnmail-split-fancy)
</pre>

<p>
This code is similar to the IMAP example, except that the default
 mailbox name for nnml is mail.misc(1).
</p>

<p>
Here's how the previous rules in nnmail-split-methods would be
 translated to nnmail-split-fancy rules for an IMAP configuration:
</p>

<pre class="example">
(setq nnmail-split-fancy
     '(|
       (: gnus-registry-split-fancy-with-parent)
        ;; splitting rules go here       
       (from mail "INBOX.errors")   ;; (1)
       (any "you@work.example.com" "INBOX.work")   ;; (2)
       (any "you@personal.example.com" "INBOX.personal") ;; 
       ("subject" "emacs" "INBOX.emacs") ;; (3)
       "INBOX"    ;; or "mail.misc" for nnml/POP3
      ))
</pre>

<p>
The <code>from</code> keyword matches against the “From”, “Sender”, and
 “Resent-From” fields, while the mail keyword matches common mail
 system addresses(1). The corresponding <code>to</code> keyword matches against
 the “To”, “Cc”, “Apparently-To”, “Resent-To” and “Resent-Cc” headers,
 while <code>any</code> matches the fields checked by the <code>from</code> and <code>to</code>
 keywords(2). You can also compare against the subject
 and other headers(3).
</p>

<p>
You can use logic in splitting rules, too. For example, if you like
 reading the jokes on joke-mailing-list@example.com, but you don't like
 the ones sent by vi-guy@example.com (he not only has a bad sense of
 humor, but also likes picking on Emacs!), you can use a rule like
 this in your nnmail-split-fancy:
</p>

<pre class="example">
;; ... other splitting rules go here...
(any "joke-mailing-list@example.com"   ;; (1)
     (| (from "vi-guy@example.com" "INBOX.junk") ;; (2)
        "INBOX.jokes")) ;; (3)
;; ... other splitting rules go here
</pre>

<p>
The first rule matches all messages with
 “joke-mailing-list@example.com” in from- or to-related headers.
 Matching messages are processed with another split rule, which moves
 messages from vi-guy@example.com to a separate group(2) and files the
 other messages in INBOX.jokes(3). To learn more about creating complex
 rules, read the Gnus Info manual for “Fancy Mail Splitting”.
