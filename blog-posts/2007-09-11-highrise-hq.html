</p>

<p>
I took a look at <a href="http://www.highrisehq.com/">Highrise HQ</a> following a
recommendation by Winston Damarillo. It's a web-based contact
relationship manager (CRM) by 37signals, so it's all pretty and Web
2.0-y.
</p>

<p>
Looking further, I'm surprised at how much my hand-hacked Emacs-based
CRM can do:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Review a colleagueÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s notes before calling her contact at
the printer</b> :: I do this with BBDB. Not only that, but my system
automatically inserts notes into any e-mail I compose to that person.
</li>
<li id="<b>See all the follow-ups scheduled for this week</b>">Got that with
Planner
</li>
<li><b>Set a reminder to write your client a thank-you note next
Friday</b> :: Ditto with Planner
</li>
<li id="<b>Keep all important emails from a customer together on one page</b>">I
suppose I could do that with mail search. There must be a better way,
though&#x2026;
</li>
<li id="<b>Schedule a follow-up sales call with a lead in 30 days</b>">Gotcha.
</li>
<li id="<b>Review all communications with your investors</b>">I haven't figured
out how to do this one yet. Mail folders help. Maybe I can hook up
BBDB with my mail search engine&#x2026;
</li>
<li><b>Build a list of all the designers your company has hired in the
past</b> :: Can do this with tags. In fact, I can build a list of people
who are tagged with A but not B and whom I've talked to in the last
year&#x2026; =)
</li>
<li id="<b>Enter notes from a call with a potential client</b>">Gotcha.
</li>
<li><b>Enter contact info for people you met at the conference this
week</b> :: Gotcha.
</li>
<li id="<b>Generate a list of contractors you worked with last year</b>">Gotcha.
</li>
<li><b>See all the people your company knows at The New York
Times</b> :: Regexp search, easy enough.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Highrise: you can share your notes with other people. I don't need that
yet, and I don't think I'll need it any time soon.
</p>

<p>
Emacs: I can use it offline. That totally rocks. Also, I can do lots
 of complicated batch operations, such as composing form letters that
 include conditional text, randomized text, and personalized
 signatures. I can add arbitrary data fields and write code to do all
 sorts of things. I don't need Firefox or a mouse.
</p>

<p>
You know, if I just figured out how to translate my setup to the Web,
 I'd make a killing. ;)
</p>

<p>
I'm going to steal the idea of a pretty view, and I'm going to make it
 easier to see all the tasks associated with a person instead of
 relying on my daily view. I also need to make it easier to mark
 something as for-followup. Hmmm&#x2026; But yeah, not too bad, not too
 bad&#x2026;

Random Emacs symbol: gnus-server-opened &#x2013; Function: Check whether a
connection to GNUS-COMMAND-METHOD has been opened. &#x2013; Face: Face used
for displaying OPENED servers
