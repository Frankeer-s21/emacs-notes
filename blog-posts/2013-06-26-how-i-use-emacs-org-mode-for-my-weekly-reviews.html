<h1 class="title">How I use Emacs Org Mode for my weekly reviews</h1>
<p>
June 26th, 2013 -
<a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/p/25043"><a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/p/25043">http://sachachua.com/blog/p/25043</a></a>
</p>

<p>
*Summary: I use a
custom*<a href="http://sachachua.com/dotemacs#weekly-review"><b>Emacs Lisp
function</b></a>*to extract my upcoming tasks and logged tasks from my Org
agenda, and I combine that with data from QuantifiedAwesome.com using a
JSON interface.*
</p>

<p>
I use <a href="http://orgmode.org">Emacs Org Mode</a> to keep track of my tasks
because of its flexibility. It's difficult to imagine doing the kinds of
things I do with a different task management system. For example, I've
written some code that extracts data from my Org Mode task list and my
QuantifiedAwesome.com time log to give me the basis of a weekly review.
Here's what my workflow is like.
</p>

<p>
Throughout the week, I add tasks to Org Mode to represent things that I
plan to do. I also create tasks for things I've done that I want to
remember, as I find that I forget things even within a week. I track my
time through <a href="http://quantifiedawesome.com">QuantifiedAwesome.com</a>, a
website I built myself for tracking things that I'm curious about.
</p>

<p>
On Saturday, I use <a href="http://sachachua.com/dotemacs#weekly-review"><b>M-x
sacha/org-prepare-weekly-review</b></a>, which:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>runs org-agenda for the upcoming week and extracts all my non-routine
tasks
</li>
<li>runs org-agenda in log mode and extracts all finished tasks from the
previous week
</li>
<li>gets the time summary from Quantified Awesome's JSON interface
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Here's what the raw output looks like:
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><a href="uploads/2013/06/image5.png"><img src="uploads/2013/06/image_thumb6.png" alt="image_thumb6.png" /></a>
</p>
</div>

<p>
I like including a list of blog posts so that people can click on them
if they missed something during the week. Besides, my blog posts often
help me remember what I did that week. I customized my WordPress theme
to give me an org-friendly list if I add ?org=1 to the date URL. For
example, here's the list for this month:
<a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2013/06/?org=1">sachachua.com/blog/2013/06/?org=1</a>
. I copy and paste the relevant part of the list (or lists, for weeks
near the beginning or end of a month) into the <b>Blog posts section</b>. I
could probably automate this, but I haven't bothered.
</p>

<p>
Then I organize the past and future tasks by topic. Topics are useful
because I can see which areas I've been focusing on and which ones I've
neglected. I do this organization manually, although I could probably
figure out how to use tags to jumpstart the process.
<code>(setq org-cycle-include-plain-lists 'integrate)</code> means that I can use
TAB to hide or show parts of the list. I use M-&lt;down&gt; and M-&lt;right&gt; for
most of the tasks, and I also cut and paste lines as needed. Because my
code sorts tasks alphabetically, I'm starting to name tasks with the
context at the beginning to make them easier to organize.
</p>

<p>
If I remember other accomplishments, I add them to this list. If I think
of other things I want to do, I add them to the list and I create tasks
for them. (I should probably write a function that does that&#x2026;)
</p>

<p>
The categories and time totals are part of the weekly review template
inserted by <code>sacha/org-prepare-weekly-review</code>. I use my smartphone or
laptop to track time whenever I switch activities, occasionally
backdating or editing records if I happen to be away or distracted. If
I'm at my computer, I sometimes estimate and track time at the task
level using Org Mode's clocking feature. Since I'm not consistent with
task-based time-tracking, I use that mainly for investigating how much
time it takes me to do specific things, and I don't automatically
include that in my reports.
</p>

<p>
When I'm done, I use
<a href="https://github.com/punchagan/org2blog"><code>org2blog/wp-post-subtree</code></a> to
publish the draft to my blog. I preview it in WordPress to make sure
everything looks all right, and then publish it.
</p>

<p>
It's wonderful being able to tweak your task manager to fit the way you
work. Yay Emacs, Org Mode, WordPress, and making your own tools!
