<p>
Quinn Fung needed some help with Muse and RDF so that she could easily
generate RSS feeds from Emacs, so we declared today to be Emacs Clinic
day at the <a href="http://www.linuxcaffe.ca">Linux Caffe</a>.
</p>

<p>
We started by getting publishing to work. We then figured out how to get
RDF to publish, and that was pretty okay too.
</p>

<p>
Quinn needed multiple authors, and muse-journal didn't support it yet,
 so we hacked it in. I told her to pick a syntax, and I added code to
 make it happen. It took us a while to track things down, but it turned
 out to be a reasonably easy addition. (I need to refactor that code
 sometime&#x2026; that's a really long function!)
</p>

<p>
Along the way, we found a bug in muse-journal. Muse-journal summarizes
entries by taking the first two sentences, but dies when the post
doesn't contain at least two periods. I spent a fair bit of time tracing
through the different changes we made before realizing that it wasn't my
bug. I probably would've found it earlier, but debug-on-error wasn't
getting honored. Odd. Anyway, here's the patch, which I'll submit to GNA
when I get back into the swing of things:
</p>

<pre class="example">

           (let ((beg (point)))
             (if (muse-style-element :summarize)
                 (progn
-                  (forward-sentence 2)

                   (setq desc (concat (buffer-substring beg (point)) "...")))
               (save-restriction
                 (muse-publish-markup-buffer "rss-entry" "html")
</pre>

<p>
Now Quinn's jumping feet-first into Lisp development by doing the Atom
 implementation. muse-atom does single-entry Atom files, but she can
 model it on muse-journal's RSS implementation.
</p>

<p>
I also helped Ian set up a very very basic Planner. It reminded me
 that I <b>really</b> need to package planner-bundle again, and either
 retire or update plannerlove. In fact, I need to set up scripts so
 that it's ridiculously easy to keep up to date&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
I miss hacking on Emacs! This is fun. I'll reconfigure my kernel and
 get VPN working. Then I'll set up my Emacs development environment
 again&#x2026;
