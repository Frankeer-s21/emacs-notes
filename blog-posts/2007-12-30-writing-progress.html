2For the chapter on task management, I have 10,715 words or 38 pages of
raw text that still need be edited. This probably means I'm going to
miss my goal of December 31. I still need to write two more sections on
using tags and projects, which will be roughly another 2,000 words. I'll
try to write another 1,000 words today. I'm planning to spend the
evenings and all of January 1 working on this. I think I can finish it
this week. I'll e-mail my editor to adjust my goal one week forward.
</p>

<p>
The next chapter is the one on taking notes. It's also 35 pages, and
I've budgeted a month for it. If I push my current deadline forward one
week, I might still be able to make it to my next deadline of January
31, 2008. The raw text should take me about six days of writing 2,000
words each. I'm planning to write about the one-file approach, Remember,
Org, Planner, Howm, Records, and blogging from Emacs. Budget in maybe
one weekend for editing, and that comes out to writing for three hours
every other weekday and doing a little more work on it during weekends.
This kind of schedule will help me avoid the mistake I did this month,
which was focusing on work during weekday evenings and working on the
book only during weekends.
</p>

<p>
I'm also happy to say that I'm getting the hang of dictating to Dragon
NaturallySpeaking. I've trained it to recognize things like Emacs and
C-c, and I'm getting used to working with a combination of typing and
speaking. I carry a portable voice recorder with me, and I dictate into
it after I've taken off my contact lenses and can't work at the
computer. I've been using it for blog posts, chapter drafts, and the
occasional rant about Emacs versioning. I'm also getting the hang of not
freaking out about the ungrammatical things that Dragon
NaturallySpeaking thinks I've said.
</p>

<p>
And I like not having to type.
