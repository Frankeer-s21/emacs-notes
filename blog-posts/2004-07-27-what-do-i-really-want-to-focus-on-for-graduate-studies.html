I think there's some promise in this planner.el thing. I'm intrigued
 by the fact that we can make personal information managers truly
 personal. Instead of adapting to the software's structures, we tend to
 adapt planner.el to our idiosyncrasies. How do people's usage patterns
 evolve? I know mine has changed several times. Could the patterns
 discovered by advanced users who tweak the framework be embedded into
 popular PIM clients and tested on novice users? For example, how would
 normal people react to automatic hyperlinking? What about the use of a
 PIM for collaborative information management, like the way people are
 using planner.el to manage teams when it was originally designed for
 personal use? Interesting stuff&#x2026;
