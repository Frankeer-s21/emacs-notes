Some people look at my website and think I'm organized. I have no idea
 what gives them that impression. Maybe it's the color-coded task list.
 Yes, yes, that must be it.
</p>

<p>
Regular readers will notice, however, that I procrastinate as much as
 anyone else. Just check my website tomorrow and see which tasks still
 aren't done. ;) In fact, if you look at the linked pages, you'll find
 lots of tasks I haven't even scheduled.
</p>

<p>
I guess I procrastinate in an organized manner. ;) Planner lets me do
 that. It doesn't guilt-trip me into productivity or nag me to do
 things. Rather, it helps me keep track of the things I'd like to
 eventually get around to doing, and it occasionally reminds me that I
 should do some of those things soon.
</p>

<p>
Planner makes working fun. I love seeing crossed-off tasks on my
 Planner. When I break things down into tiny little pieces and cross
 them off my list, it feels good. On the other hand, if I don't manage
 to cross off anything on my list, that means I had either made
 progress on at least one task or had fun doing something unexpected.

I love surprises, too. Today I had lunch with Clair and Madj at
 Greenbelt. Totally unplanned&#x2014;actually, I was just planning to sleep
 in&#x2014;but totally, totally fun. Then my mom and I went to a wedding in
 Alabang, and that was surprisingly wonderful and sweet&#x2026; =)
