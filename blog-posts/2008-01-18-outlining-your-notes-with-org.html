<p>
Large documents are almost impossible to write without outlines. There's
just too much to fit in your head. Outlines help you work with a
structure, so that you can see the big picture and how sections fit
together. Outlines are also surprisingly useful when brainstorming. You
can work with varying levels of detail, starting with a high-level
overview and successively refining it, or starting with the details and
then letting the structure emerge as you organize those details into
groups.
</p>

<p>
Emacs has one of the most powerful outline editors I've come across.
Although word processors like Microsoft Word and OpenOffice.org Writer
support outlines too, Emacs has a gazillion keyboard shortcuts, and once
you get the hang of them, you'll want them in other applications as
well. In addition, working in Emacs tends to force you to focus on the
content instead of spending time fiddling with the formatting. Whether
you're writing personal notes or working on a document that's due
tomorrow, this is a good thing.
</p>

<p>
In this section, you'll learn how to outline a document using Org.
You'll be able to create headings, sub-headings, and text notes. You'll
also learn how to manage outline items by promoting, demoting, and
rearranging them.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1">Understanding Org</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
Org is primarily a personal information manager that keeps track of your
tasks and schedule, and you'll learn more about those features in
chapters 8 and 9. However, Org also has powerful outline-management
tools, which is why I recommend it to people who want to write and
organize outlined notes.
</p>

<p>
The structure of an Org file is simple: a plain text file with
headlines, text, and some additional information such as tags and
timestamps. A headline is any line that stars with a series of
asterisks. The more asterisks there are, the deeper the headline is. A
second-level headline is the child of the first-level headline before
it, and so on. For example:
</p>

<pre class="example">
* This is a first-level headline
Some text under that headline
** This is a second-level headline
Some more text here
*** This is a third-level headline
*** This is another third-level headline
** This is a second-level headline
</pre>

<p>
Because Org uses plain text, it's easy to back up or process using
scripts. Org's sophistication comes from keyboard shortcuts that allow
you to quickly manipulate headlines, hide and show outline subtrees, and
search for information.
</p>

<p>
GNU Emacs 22 includes Org. To automatically enable Org mode for all
files with the .org extension, add the following to your ~/.emacs:
</p>

<pre class="example">
(require 'org)
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.org$" . org-mode))
</pre>

<p>
To change to org-mode manually, use M-x org-mode while viewing a file.
To enable Org on a per-file basis, add
</p>

<pre class="example">
-*- mode: org -*-
</pre>

<p>
to the first line of the files that you would like to associate with
Org.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2">Working with Outlines</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
You can keep your notes in more than one Org file, but let's start by
creating ~/notes.org. Open ~/notes.org, which will automatically be
associated with Org Mode. Type in the general structure of your
document. You can type in something like this:
</p>

<pre class="example">
* Introduction
* ...
</pre>

<p>
You can also use M-RET (org-meta-return) to create a new headline at the
same level as the one above it, or a first-level headline if the
document doesn't have headlines yet.
</p>

<p>
Create different sections for your work. For example, a thesis might be
divided into introduction, review of related literature, description of
study, methodology, results and analysis, and conclusions and
recommendations. You can type in the starting asterisks yourself, or you
can use M-RET (org-meta-return) to create headings one after the other.
</p>

<p>
Now that you have the basic structure, start refining it. Go to the
first section and use a command like C-o (open-line) to create blank
space. Add another headline, but this time, make it a second-level
headline under the first. You can do that by either typing in two
asterisks or by using M-RET (org-meta-return, which calls
org-insert-heading) and then M-right (org-metaright, which calls
org-do-demote). Then use M-RET (org-meta-return; org-insert-heading) for
the other items, or type them in yourself. Repeat this for other
sections, and go into as much detail as you want.
</p>

<p>
What if you want to reorganize your outline? For example, what if you
realized you'd accidentally put your conclusions before the
introduction? You could either cut and paste it using Emacs shortcuts,
or you can use Org's outline management functions. The following
keyboard shortcuts are handy:

<p>
Use these commands to help you reorganize your outline as you create a
skeleton for your document. These commands make it easy to change your
mind about the content or order of sections. You might find it easier to
sketch a rough outline first, then gradually fill in more and more
detail. On the other hand, you might find it easier to pick one section
and keep drilling it down until you have headlines some seven levels
deep. When you reach that point, all you need to do is add punctuation
and words like "and" or "but" between every other outline item, and
you're done!
</p>

<p>
Well, no, not likely. You'll probably get stuck somewhere, so here are
some tips for keeping yourself going when you're working on a large
document in Org: brainstorming and getting a sense of your progress.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3">Brainstorming</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
Brainstorming is a great way to break your writer's block or to generate
lots of possibilities. The key idea is to come up with as many ideas as
you can, and write them all down before you start evaluating them.
</p>

<p>
I usually switch to paper for mindmapping and brainstorming because
paper helps me think in a more colorful and non-linear way. However, it
can be hard to manage large mindmaps on paper, because you can't
reorganize nodes easily. Despite its text-heavy interface, Org is one of
the best mindmapping tools I've come across. Because it's built into
Emacs, everything can be done through keyboard shortcuts.
</p>

<p>
When you're brainstorming, you might like working from two different
directions. Sometimes it's easier to start with an outline and to add
more and more detail. Other times, you may want to jot quick ideas and
then organize them into groups that make sense. Org provides support for
both ways of working.
</p>

<p>
Brainstorming bottom-up is similar to David Allen's Getting Things Done
method in that separating collection from organization is a good idea.
That is, get the ideas out of your head first before you spend time
trying to figure out the best way to organize them. To get things out of
your head quickly, collect your ideas by using the M-RET
(org-meta-return) to create a new heading, typing in your idea, and
using M-RET (org-meta-return) to create the next heading. Do this as
many times as needed.
</p>

<p>
One way to encourage yourself to brainstorm lots of ideas is to give
yourself a quota. Charles Cave described this technique in an
<a href="http://members.optusnet.com.au/~charles57/GTD/Natural_Project_Planning.html">article
on org-mode</a>, and it's a great way to use structure to prompt
creativity. Simply start by adding a number of empty headings (say, 20),
then work towards filling that quota. For example, you might start with
ten blanks for ideas, then gradually fill them in like this:
</p>

<pre class="example">
* Things that make me happy
** Curling up with a good book
** Watching a brilliant sunset
** Giving or getting a big warm hug
** Writing a cool piece of Emacs code
** 
** 
** 
**
** 
**
</pre>

<p>
When all of your ideas are in Org, start organizing them. This is where
you move ideas around using M-S-up (org-shiftmetaup) and M-S-down
(org-shift-metadown), which call org-move-subtree-up and
org-move-subtree-down. This is also a good time to use headings to group
things together.
</p>
</div>

<h2 id="sec-4">Getting a Sense of Progress</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
You've brainstormed. You've started writing your notes. And if you're
working on a large document, you might lose steam at some point along
the way. For example, while working on this book, I often find myself
intimidated by just how much there is to write about Emacs. It helps to
have a sense of progress such as the number of words written or the
number of sections completed. To see a word count that updates every
second, add this code to your ~/.emacs:
</p>

<pre class="example">
(defvar count-words-buffer
  nil
  "*Number of words in the buffer.")

(defun wicked/update-wc ()
  (interactive)
  (setq count-words-buffer (number-to-string (count-words-buffer)))
  (force-mode-line-update))

; only setup timer once
(unless count-words-buffer
  ;; seed count-words-paragraph
  ;; create timer to keep count-words-paragraph updated
  (run-with-idle-timer 1 t 'wicked/update-wc))

;; add count words paragraph the mode line
(unless (memq 'count-words-buffer global-mode-string)
  (add-to-list 'global-mode-string "words: " t)
  (add-to-list 'global-mode-string 'count-words-buffer t)) 

;; count number of words in current paragraph
(defun count-words-buffer ()
  "Count the number of words in the current paragraph."
  (interactive)
  (save-excursion
    (goto-char (point-min))
    (let ((count 0))
      (while (not (eobp))
    (forward-word 1)
        (setq count (1+ count)))
      count)))
</pre>

<p>
The best way I've found to track my progress in terms of sections is to
use a checklist. For example, the collapsed view for this section looks
like this:
</p>

<pre class="example">
** Outline Notes with Org [7/9]    ;; (1)
*** [X] Outlining Your Notes...    ;; (2)
*** [X] Understanding Org...
*** [X] Working with Outlines...
*** [X] Brainstorming...
*** [ ] Getting a Sense of Progress... ;; (3)
*** [X] Searching Your Notes...
*** [X] Hyperlinks...
*** [X] Publishing Your Notes...
*** [ ] Integrating Remember with Org
</pre>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>(1): <code>[7/9]</code> shows that I've completed 7 of 9 parts.
</li>
<li>(2): [X] indicates finished parts.
</li>
<li>(3): [ ] indicates parts I still need to do.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
This is based on the checklist feature in Org. However, the standard
feature works only with lists like this:
</p>

<pre class="example">
*** Items [1/3]
- [X] Item 1
- [ ] Item 2
- [ ] Item 3
</pre>

<p>
Add the following code to your ~/.emacs in order to make the function
work with headlines:
</p>

<pre class="example">
(defun wicked/org-update-checkbox-count (&amp;optional all)
  "Update the checkbox statistics in the current section.
This will find all statistic cookies like [57%] and [6/12] and update
them with the current numbers.  With optional prefix argument ALL,
do this for the whole buffer."
  (interactive "P")
  (save-excursion
    (let* ((buffer-invisibility-spec (org-inhibit-invisibility)) 
       (beg (condition-case nil
            (progn (outline-back-to-heading) (point))
          (error (point-min))))
       (end (move-marker
         (make-marker)
         (progn (or (outline-get-next-sibling) ;; (1)
                (goto-char (point-max)))
            (point))))   
       (re "\\(\\[[0-9]*%\\]\\)\\|\\(\\[[0-9]*/[0-9]*\\]\\)")

    (goto-char e1)

        (if (member (match-string 2) '("[ ]" "[-]"))
        (setq c-off (1+ c-off))
          (setq c-on (1+ c-on))))
      (goto-char b1)
      (insert (if f1
              (format "[%d%%]" (/ (* 100 c-on)
                      (max 1 (+ c-on c-off))))
            (format "[%d/%d]" c-on (+ c-on c-off))))
      (and (looking-at "\\[.*?\\]")
           (replace-match ""))))
      (when (interactive-p)
    (message "Checkbox statistics updated %s (%d places)"
         (if all "in entire file" "in current outline entry")
         cstat)))))
(defadvice org-update-checkbox-count (around wicked activate)
  "Fix the built-in checkbox count to understand headlines."
  (setq ad-return-value
    (wicked/org-update-checkbox-count (ad-get-arg 1))))
</pre>

<p>
Now add [ ] or [X] to the lower-level headlines you want to track. Add
<code>[/]</code> to the end of the higher-level headline containing those headlines.
Type C-c # (org-update-checkbox-count) to update the count for the
current headline, or C-u C-c C-# (org-update-checkbox-count) to update
all checkbox counts in the whole buffer.
</p>

<p>
If you want to see the percentage of completed items, use <code>[%]</code> instead of
<code>[/]</code>. I find 7/9 to be easier to understand than 71%, but fractions might
work better for other cases.
</p>

<p>
Okay, you've written a lot. How do you find information again?
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-5" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-5">Searching Your Notes</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<p>
When you're writing your notes, you might need to refer to something
you've written. You may find it helpful to split your screen in two with
C-x 3 (split-window-horizontally) or C-x 2 (split-window-vertically). To
switch to another window, type C-x o (other-window) or click on the
window. To return to just one window, use C-x 1 (delete-other-windows)
to focus on just the current window, or C-x 0 (delete-window) to get rid
of the current window.
</p>

<p>
Now that you've split your screen, how do you quickly search through
your notes? C-s (isearch-forward) and C-r (isearch-backward) are two of
the most useful Emacs keyboard shortcuts you'll ever learn. Use them to
not only interactively search your Org file, but also to quickly jump to
sections. For example, I often search for headlines by typing * and the
first word. Org searches collapsed sections, so you don't need to open
everything before searching.
</p>

<p>
To search using Org's outline structure, use C-c / r (org-sparse-tree,
regexp), which will show only entries matching a regular expression. For
more information about regular expressions, read the Emacs info manual
entry on Regexps. Here are a few examples:
</p>

<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">


<colgroup>
<col  class="left" />

<col  class="left" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="left"><b>To find</b></td>
<td class="left"><b>Search for</b></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="left">All entries containing "cat"</td>
<td class="left">cat</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="left">All entries that contain "cat" as a word by itself (example: "cat," but not "catch")</td>
<td class="left">\&lt;cat\&gt;</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="left">All entries that contain 2006, 2007, or 2008</td>
<td class="left">200<sup><a id="fnr.1" name="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-6" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-6">Hyperlinks</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-6">
<p>
If you find yourself frequently searching for some sections, you might
want to create hyperlinks to them. For example, if you're using one file
for all of your project notes instead of splitting it up into one file
per project, then you probably want a list of projects at the beginning
of the file so that you can jump to each project quickly.
</p>

<p>
You can also use hyperlinks to keep track of your current working
position. For example, if you're working on a long document and you want
to keep your place, create a link anchor like <a id="TODO" name="TODO"></a> at the point
where you're editing, and add a link like <a href="#TODO">6</a> at the beginning of
your file.
</p>

<p>
You can create a hyperlink to a text search by putting the keywords
between two pairs of square brackets, like this:
</p>

<pre class="example">
See [[things that make me happy]]
</pre>

<p>
You can open the link by moving the point to the link and typing C-c C-o
(org-open-at-point). You can also click on the link to open it. Org will
then search for text matching the query. If Org doesn't find an exact
match, it tries to match similar text, such as "Things that make me
really really happy".
</p>

<p>
If you find that the link does not go where you want it to go, you can
limit the text search. For example, if you want to link to a headline
and you know the headline will be unique, you can add an asterisk at the
beginning of the link text in order to limit the search to headlines.
For example, given the following text:
</p>

<pre class="example">
In this file, I'll write notes on the things that make me happy. (1)
If I ever need a spot of cheering up, I'll know just what to do! 

** Things that make me happy (2) 
*** ...

Example 
Link 1: [[things that make me happy]] 

Link 2: [[*things that make me happy]]
</pre>

<p>
Link 1 would lead to (1), and Link 2 would lead to (2).
</p>

<p>
To define a link anchor, put the text in double angled brackets like
this:
</p>

<pre class="example">
&lt;&lt;things that make me happy&gt;&gt;
</pre>

<p>
A link like <i>things that make me happy</i> would then link to that
instead of other occurances of the text.
</p>

<p>
You can define keywords that will be automatically hyperlinked
throughout the file by using radio targets. For example, if you're
writing a jargon-filled document and you frequently need to refer to the
definitions, it may help to make a glossary of terms such as "regexp"
and "radio target", and then define them in a glossary section at the
end of the file, like this:
</p>

<pre class="example">
*** glossary
&lt;&lt;&lt;radio target&gt;&gt;&gt; A word or phrase that is automatically hyperlinked whenever it appears. 
&lt;&lt;&lt;regexp&gt;&gt;&gt; A regular expression. See the Emacs info manual.
</pre>

<p>
Radio targets are automatically enabled when an Org file is opened in
Emacs. If you've just added a radio target, enable it by moving the
point to the anchor and pressing C-c C-c (org-ctrl-c-ctrl-c). This turns
all instances of the text into hyperlinks that point to the radio
target.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-7" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-7">Publishing Your Notes</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-7">
<p>
You can keep your notes as a plain text file, or you can publish them as
HTML or LaTeX. HTML seems to be the easiest way to let non-Emacs users
read your notes, as a large text file without pretty colors can be hard
to read.
</p>

<p>
To export a file to any of the formats that Org understands by default,
type C-c C-e (org-export). You can then type ‘h' (org-export-as-html) to
export it as HTML for websites. You can also type ‘l'
(org-export-as-latex) to export it to LaTeX, a scientific typesetting
language, which can then be published as PDF or PS. Another way to
convert it to PDF is to export it as HTML, open it in OpenOffice.org
Writer, and use the Export to PDF feature. You can also open HTML
documents in other popular word processors to convert them to other
supported formats.
</p>

<p>
By default, Org exports all the content in the current file. To limit it
only to the visible content, use C-c C-e v (org-export-visible) followed
by either ‘h' for HTML or ‘l' for LaTeX.
</p>

<p>
If you share your notes, you may want to export an HTML version every
time you save an Org file. Here is a quick and dirty way to publish all
Org files to HTML every time you save them:
</p>

<pre class="example">
(defun wicked/org-publish-files-maybe ()
  "Publish this file."
  (org-export-as-html-batch)
  nil)
(add-hook 'org-mode-hook  ;; (1)
 (lambda () 
  (add-hook (make-local-variable 'after-save-hook) ;; (2)
            'wicked/org-publish-files-maybe)))
</pre>

<p>
(Update: Feb 22 2011: Thanks to Neilen for the fix!)
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>(1) Every time a buffer is set to Org mode&#x2026;
</li>
<li>(2) Add a function that publishes the file every time that file is
saved.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
What if most of your files are private, but you want to publish only a
few of them? To control this, let's add a new special keyword
"#+PUBLISH" to the beginning of the files that you want to be
automatically published. Replace the previous code in your ~/.emacs with
this:
</p>

<pre class="example">
(defun wicked/org-publish-files-maybe ()
  "Publish this file if it contains the #+PUBLISH: keyword"
  (save-excursion
   (save-restriction
    (widen)
    (goto-char (point-min))
    (when (re-search-forward 
           "^#?[ \t]*\\+\\(PUBLISH\\)"
           nil t) 
     (org-export-as-html-batch)   
     nil))))

(add-hook 'org-mode-hook
 (lambda ()
  (add-hook (make-local-variable 'after-save-hook)
            'wicked/org-publish-files-maybe)))
</pre>

<p>
and add #+PUBLISH on a line by itself to your ~/notes.org file, like
this:
</p>

<pre class="example">
#+PUBLISH
* Things that make me happy
</pre>

<p>
When you save any Org file that contains the keyword, the corresponding
HTML page will also be created. You can then use a program like rsync or
scp to copy the file to a webserver, or you can copy it to a shared
directory.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-8">
<p>
You can use Remember to collect notes that you will later integrate into
your outline. Add the following code to your ~/.emacs to set it up:
</p>

<pre class="example">
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c r") 'remember)    ;; (1)
(add-hook 'remember-mode-hook 'org-remember-apply-template) ;; (2)
(setq org-remember-templates  
      '((?n "* %U %?\n\n  %i\n  %a" "~/notes.org")))  ;; (3)
(setq remember-annotation-functions '(org-remember-annotation)) ;; (4)
(setq remember-handler-functions '(org-remember-handler)) ;; (5)
</pre>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>1: Handy keyboard shortcut for (r)emember
</li>
<li>2: Creates a template for (n)otes
</li>
<li>3: Create a note template which saves the note to ~/notes.org, or
whichever Org file you want to use
</li>
<li>4: Creates org-compatible context links
</li>
<li>5: Saves remembered notes to an Org file
</li>
</ul>

<p>
With this code, you can type C-c r n (remember, Notes template) to pop
up a buffer (usually containing a link to whatever you were looking at),
write your note, and type C-c C-c (remember-buffer) to save the note and
close the buffer.
</p>

<p>
You can use this to store snippets in your notes file, or to quickly
capture an idea that comes up when you're doing something else.
</p>

<p>
Now you know how to sketch an outline, reorganize it, fill it in,
brainstorm, stay motivated, and publish your notes. I look forward to
reading what you have to share!
