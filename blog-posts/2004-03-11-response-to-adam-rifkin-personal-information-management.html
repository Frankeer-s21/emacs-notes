</p>

<p>
I like your <a href="http://www.mod-pubsub.org/blog/index.php">technical</a> and
<a href="http://ifindkarma.typepad.com/relax/">personal</a> and I think I can
learn much from you. =)
</p>

<p>
In particular, I am interested in personal information management. I
 maintain
<a href="http://sachachua.com/notebook/wiki/PlannerMode">PlannerMode</a>, an
organizer for Emacs. I use it to blog
 (<a href="http://sacha.free.net.ph"><a href="http://sacha.free.net.ph">http://sacha.free.net.ph</a></a>). My Emacs
setup allows me to hit a
 keystroke to remember anything from almost anywhere. It automatically
 captures context and allows me to jump back to that. The source pages
 are on my hard disk, so I regularly regexp-search through them. This
 lets me use my blog to remember things.
</p>

<p>
People are surprised to find my task list, schedule and notes online.
 They ask me why I don't mind the lack of privacy. I find that
 publishing my notes works to my advantage. Almost every other day,
 someone writes in with a bit of info or a tip that'll help me finish a
 task. Plus, publishing my task list shames me into procrastinating
 less.
</p>

<p>
I'd like to work on making it easier to retrieve information from my
 blog and my e-mail. The Remembrance Agent

is great for
 indexing mail and a few other resources. It brings up entries that are
 relevant to the words around your cursor. You've probably run across
 the software and related papers&#x2014;if not, check it out!
</p>

<p>
I'm also interested in XML. I hacked in RSS export for my blog. It
 autocategorizes my posts based on a regular expression. A minor
 modification will let me define arbitrary rules.

<p>
Answering JP, someone else on the
<a href="http://www.mod-pubsub.org/blog/index.php">technical</a> groupblog:
</p>

<p>
I like the idea of RSS syndication because I want to aggregate and
 search blogs without having to scrape HTML. With either a simple
 regexp search or search-engine-like relevance ranking, finding
 information in other people's knowledgebases becomes much easier. If I
 download feeds, I can even search offline. Push on creation is useful,
 but people still need a way to get to old posts.
