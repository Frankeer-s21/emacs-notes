March 31st, 2010 -
<a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/p/7130"><a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/p/7130">http://sachachua.com/blog/p/7130</a></a>
</p>

<p>
In June 2009, I
<a href="http://sachachua.com/wp/2009/06/changing-hats/">switched hats</a> and
started facilitating workshops instead of developing Drupal code.
Organizing resources and learning more about consulting kept me in a
mostly-Windows environment with little reason to delve into the
mysteries of the Emacs text editor, although I occasionally used Emacs
to
<a href="http://sachachua.com/wp/2009/11/automating-tedious-wiki-editing-tasks-with-emacs-and-w3m">automate
repetitive editing tasks</a>.
</p>

<p>
Even though I haven't played around with Emacs for a while, the text
editor&#x2014;and the community around it&#x2014;hasn't let go of me yet. My
Emacs-related posts remain among the most popular on my blog, and people
often write to me to ask questions or thank me for inspiration. I still
keep <a href="http://planet.emacsen.org">Planet Emacsen</a> in my feed reader,
and I occasionally drop by the <a href="http://emacswiki.org">Emacs Wiki</a>.
</p>

<p>
I miss working on Wicked Cool Emacs. I've turned it over to
<a href="http://twitter.com/IEURE">Ian Eure</a>, whom I assume is persistently
plugging away at it (although he might also have gotten distracted by
real life as well&#x2013;totally understandable). Now that I'm no longer
distracted by the fun of tweaking Drupal (almost as flexible as Emacs,
thanks to its hook system), Emacs calls.
</p>

<p>
I miss geeking out in #emacs on irc.freenode.net, helping people with
questions on mailing lists, and playing with ideas that can be
translated into code.
</p>

<p>
So I'm dusting off my configuration files and my notes, writing an
org-toodledo module that pulls in my tasks from the web-based Toodledo
task management system I've been using, and developing a rudimentary
synchronization system that will help me make the transition.
