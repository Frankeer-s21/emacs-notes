<p>
Now that I have more control over the tools I use, I use Emacs for more
of my planning. I'm back to using Org Mode to manage my task list
(hooray!), and it has grown by leaps and bounds. I'm looking forward to
getting even deeper into it.
</p>

<p>
<b>Here's where I am in terms of Emacs</b>
</p>

<p>
I'm still on Microsoft Windows 7 because I like some of the drawing
programs that I can't get to run on Linux, so my Emacs experience is
less than ideal but still okay. It's one of the first applications I
start after a reboot, and I keep Emacs open almost all the time. I've
pinned Emacs to my task bar (right-click on the icon and pin it) and
moved it to the first slot, so Win+1 gets me back to Emacs.
</p>

<p>
When I'm at my client site, I use the laptop they provided to do work,
and I use a wiki page to manage and publish my task list. I use Emacs
during the early morning, the evening, weekends, and personal days.
</p>

<p>
I use <code>org-capture</code> to quickly capture tasks and notes. Here are some of
the templates I use:
</p>

<pre class="example">
(setq org-capture-templates
      '(("t" "Tasks" entry
         (file+headline "~/personal/organizer.org" "Tasks")
         "* TODO %?
SCHEDULED: %^t")
        ("q" "Quick task" entry
         (file+headline "~/personal/organizer.org" "Tasks")
         "* TODO %^{Task}
SCHEDULED: %^t"
         :immediate-finish t)
        ;; other entries go here
        ("r" "Notes" entry
         (file+datetree "~/personal/organizer.org" "Inbox")
         "* %?\n\n%i\n"
         :clock-in :clock-resume)))
</pre>

<p>
The Org agenda helps me check what I need to do. I have it set up to
display the time grid so that I get a relative sense of where things
are. I use a 2-day view so that tomorrow is in my peripheral vision.
</p>

<p>
<b>Here are some things I want to explore:</b>
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Improve the integration of Org and my self-tracking system at
<a href="http://quantifiedawesome.com">quantifiedawesome.com</a>
</li>
<li>Use Org for blog posts with images (I don't quite trust it yet,
although I've used it before)
</li>
<li>Take notes in Org Contacts instead of stuffing notes into BBDB
</li>
<li>Read the <a href="http://news.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.orgmode">Org Mode
mailing list</a> and <a href="http://planet.emacsen.org">Planet Emacsen</a> more
often to get inspiration, maybe contribute patches
</li>
<li>Get MobileOrg working for me smoothly on my Android &#x2013; need to get
the hang of the workflow
</li>
<li>Use Org's literate programming support to annotate my Emacs
configuration
</li>
</ul>
