I like using Emacs <a href="http://www.orgmode.org">Org-mode</a> to organize my
notes. One of the things it makes it easy to do is to keep a weekly
review. I used to switch between using Windows Live Writer and using
Emacs Org to draft the post, but with org2blog, I've been using Org more
and more. Here's how I use it.
</p>

<p>
At the beginning of my ~/personal/organizer.org, I have a headline for *
Weekly review. Underneath it is a template that makes it easy for me to
review my current projects and make sure that I've got next actions for
each of them. Below that is a reverse-chronological list of weekly
reviews, with the most recent weekly review first. This allows me to
easily review my weekly priorities and copy that into a new entry.
Here's what the first part of my Org file looks like (minus the spaces
at the beginning of the line)
</p>

<p>
Most of the time, I leave the template section collapsed, and the “Plans
from last week” expanded. Throughout the week, I cross items off and add
quick notes about other accomplishments. When I reach the next week, I
create a new entry, move the “Plans for next week” subtree and rename it
“From last week's plans”. When I do my weekly review (or throughout the
week, as I notice new items), I create a “Plans for next week” section
and fill it in. The editing can easily be automated, but I'll tinker
with it a bit first before writing code.
</p>

<p>
This approach means duplicate information in my task list. It would be
interesting to use TODO items instead of list items for tracking my
weekly priorities, with possible integration with my web-based task list
through org-toodledo. However, I'd need to write code to make the TODO
items publish as neatly as this list gets published using org2blog, and
I don't feel like going into that yet.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, that's how I'm currently doing it. =)
