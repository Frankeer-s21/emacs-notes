 knows what it's like to fade into the background if one has a
 partner in crime. I don't really have that problem, probably because
 people are, like, “Ooh! a girl!” Kinda.
</p>

<p>
I like being a girl. I like turning up to tech conferences in dresses
 and earrings. I like hacking my computer T-shirts into something with
 more style. I like being me.
</p>

<p>
I like sneaking into tech get-togethers like the Linux Users Group or
 Ruby Users Group without worrying about technical credibility. I blend
 in. I'm part of the woodwork. People will just assume that I'm
 someone's girlfriend.
</p>

<p>
I like playing up my social aspect. I like connecting with people.
 Most people find it hard to reach out. They think it's easier for me
 because I'm a girl. Maybe it is. Maybe it isn't. Maybe I just use
 being a girl as an excuse to get over my nervousness. =)
</p>

<p>
If I have to bat my eyelashes at people and bribe them with homemade
 cookies, so be it.
</p>

<p>
If I have to jolt people out of their stereotypes by asking
 well-thought questions, I do so with great gusto.
</p>

<p>
If I have to bring out my laptop and do some console work in front of
 them to show them I've got the chops, fine.
</p>

<p>
And when the shadows in my head whisper that I'm not as good as the
 others, not as geeky as the others, I drown them in Emacs Lisp. ;)

A talkative person is always letting the cat out of the bag and
jeopardizing the interests of others.
