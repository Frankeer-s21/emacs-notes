I have about 41 pages for my current chapter on taking notes in Emacs,
and I still have to write the introduction and wrap-up sections. This
means that I'll need to do some more editing. It's clearly time to apply
another piece of advice from the wonderful book
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ASIN=0898795141&tag=ws&lcode=sp1&cID=2025&ccmID=165953&location=/o/ASIN/0898795141%253FSubscriptionId=0525E2PQ81DD7ZTWTK82">How
to Write Fast (While Writing Well),</a> by David Fryxell: don't
over-write, because the time you waste writing more than necessary and
then editing down to the required length could be spent writing about
something else!
</p>

<p>
I also rock because I'm getting the hang of writing macros for
OpenOffice.org. Basic is not my favorite language and OpenOffice.org
macro programming is sufficiently obscure that it's hard to find
examples of what I want to do.
<a href="http://www.ooomacros.org/dev.php">OOoMacros.org</a> helped me learn
enough to write a few more functions to make my writing life better. I
wrote two new functions today: one to mark up wingdings in my code, and
another to mark up the source code examples. Both save me lots of
tedious work. The wingding function replaced all instances of (1), ;;
(1), (2), ;; (2), until (9) and ;; (9) with the corresponding wingding.
The example function marked up everything enclosed in
&lt;example&gt;..&lt;/example&gt; tags, formatting the first and last lines in a
different style and using a single-line code style for short examples.
Between that and the two functions I'd previously written to format
about 80% of my command and keyboard shortcuts, editing is just so much
better.

It seems that most people don't tinker with their tools. I like doing
so. I like getting to know what I can do with a tool and how far I can
push it. This can be frustrating sometimes (I spent all afternoon trying
to get Emacs to play nicely with other weblogs!), but most of the time,
it's both fun and useful. Not only am I saving myself time, I'm also
exercising my brain and opening opportunities for other hacks down the
line. This is good.
</p>

<p>
Oh! And W- is giving
<a href="http://www.newartisans.com/software/ledger.html">Ledger</a> a try. The
tool he'd been using to keep track of finances dropped some more of his
data recently. Because it's all magic inside, he couldn't figure out
what happened. I'd been going on about how awesome Ledger is, this
command-line double-entry accounting tool that provides no bells or
whistles but with which I can do all sorts of crazy things. He described
how he wanted to budget, and I showed him how to do it. No screencast,
but I do plan to review the audio and create some supporting materials
for my upcoming article on Ledger and Gnuplot.

<p>
Life is good. =)
