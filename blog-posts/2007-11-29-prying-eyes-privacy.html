<a href="http://tedroden.com/emacs/prying_eyes_privacy.ejr">Ted Roden uses
ROT13 to protect his secrets from prying eyes</a>, which
 comes in pretty handy when you're keeping gift lists on a shared
 computer.
</p>

<p>
My boyfriend would probably be stumped by that for all of two seconds.
 See, my significant other is a geek, and can spot ROT13 a mile away. I
 wouldn't be surprised if he could decode them in his head, as we used
 to do cryptograms over meals. Morse is also easy to recognize and
 break. If he were really determined to find out my secrets, that
 wouldn't help at all.

Nothing but strong encryption will do. Fortunately, Emacs makes this
 very easy. I keep sensitive account information in a text file called
 “numbers.gpg”. Following the instructions on

, I've set up
 automatic GnuPG encryption for files ending in .gpg. When I open the
 file, I'm prompted for my passphrase. When I save the file, the data
 is encrypted again.
</p>

<p>
If I want to encrypt just bits of a file, like the way I sometimes do
 encrypted sections in blog entries, I select the region and use M-x
 pgg-encrypt-region. This replaces the text with something like this:

Granted, my secret key is on the hard disk, but I use a strong
 password for that one.

<p>
All of this is overkill for holiday shopping lists, of course, as my
 boyfriend would never think of snooping in my files anyway. But hey,
 it's always a good idea to keep some parts of your life hush-hush. If
 I were \<sub>really\</sub>_ paranoid, I'd think about something like OrdoEmacs in
 Cryptonomicon. (Of \<sub>course\</sub>_ it had to be OrdoEmacs. OrdoVi would just
 be an abomination. ;) )
</p>

<p>
Ah, Emacs. You try doing \<sub>that\</sub>_ in Microsoft Word! ;)
