My Emacs Org-mode talk at GTALUG was a lot of fun. I had made a quick
outline of things I wanted to cover, and the discussion took us to all
sorts of places &#x2013; really more like a romp through the world of Emacs. I
kept my talk plan small and tightly-focused &#x2013; not even Org-mode, just
note-taking in Org-mode &#x2013; but I ended up talking about all sorts of
things because they were cool and that's where the discussion took us.
This means that my outline isn't much use for reconstructing the talk,
but maybe whoever recorded it can share the audio and the video. =)
</p>

<p>
Unexpected wow moments of the day, completely not in my outline:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Someone's question about my tablet PC led to showing off
<code>M-x   artist-mode</code>, drawing using my tablet, and the line and
spraycan tools. (I'd never tried it before. It works!)
</li>
<li>A conversation on the way to the talk led to my showing <code>M-x snake.</code>
</li>
<li>Someone's joking query about whether you can run vi in Emacs
(following up on someone who mentioned the vi emulation mode,
perhaps) led to my demonstrating <code>vim</code> in <code>M-x term</code>, which naturally
led to running console Emacs within my Emacs.
</li>
<li>Someone mentioned mail, so I showed Gnus, and another person
mentioned adaptive scoring, and we talked about news-inspired
techniques for dealing with e-mail.
</li>
<li>People asked me how big my config file had gotten. The word count
tool says 226k characters &#x2013; ah, the process of accretion. You can
learn Emacs and customize it a little bit at a time, though!
</li>
</ul>

<p>
I've given two Emacs talks so far, and both of them had delightful
audience interaction &#x2013; among the best of any of the talks I've given. I
think it's because with Emacs, even people's jokes give me a starting
point to mention something I've learned about or come across or built.
The energy of the session is really something different. It's almost
like an infomercial-ish “But wait, there's more!”, but everyone's in on
the joke, they're part of what's happening. It's an adventure.
</p>

<p>
I don't want to give the impression that Emacs is just about fun. ;) Of
all the software I've ever used, I think Emacs has contributed the most
to my productivity and my learning. Not only do I find the direct
benefits useful, I also really appreciate the inspiration I get from all
these other people who use and improve Emacs.
</p>

<p>
So the key question I want to address with more thought is: <b>where does
one find the time to learn these things?</b> I think you answer this the
same way you make the time for things that matter &#x2013; strategic
optimization. Like in code, premature optimization doesn't work. You
need to figure out what actions are important and where improvements
would have the most effect &#x2013; where your moments of truth are. For
example, it really pays to improve my abilities in programming, writing,
and note-taking, because I do that a lot and it creates a lot of value
at work and in life. On the other hand, I don't stress out about typing
even faster, because that's not my bottleneck. And I also make sure to
invest time into all sorts of other aspects of life, because those are
important to me too.
</p>

<p>
Back to Emacs and the presentation. My goal for the talk wasn't to
convert anyone or show people specifically how to set up their
environment. I wanted to give people an idea of what my workflow looks
like, expose them to some of the things Emacs can do, and perhaps
inspire people to learn more about their tools. (I made sure to mention
lots of cool things about vi, too!) We started at 7:30 and had a great
discussion for two hours (two hours!) that flew by until the organizers
suggested it was time to wrap up. Quite a few people came up to me
afterwards and told me that they were inspired to learn more about
Emacs. Whee!
</p>

<p>
That was tons of fun. I'd do it again. It has to be an interactive
group, somewhat casual (so that people feel free to interject questions)
and technical (helps to have a few other Emacs users in the audience,
and a general interest in tools). Voice is probably a huge component of
it &#x2013; both being able to communicate enthusiasm and for the
conversational aspect of the discussion. Screen-sharing or projection is
vital; this kind of talk wouldn't have worked with slides. So it's
probably a talk I'd need to give in person, considering webconference
interaction patterns and screen-sharing delays. Hmm&#x2026;

(Maureen: there is a
<a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ScreenPlay">screenplay mode for
Emacs</a>. Isn't that amazing? Might be worth learning Emacs. More
