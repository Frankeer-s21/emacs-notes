</p>

<p>
Each day brings an opportunity for me to reaffirm my decision that
 connecting with people is important to me and that I want to learn how
 to be really good at building and maintaining relationships. I've been
 spending a fair bit of time thinking about the tools for doing so,
 from my extensive customizations of the Emacs Big Brother Database
 to <a href="http://sachachua.com/notebook/wiki/2006.08.31.php#anchor-6">why I
like OpenBC</a>.
</p>

<p>
Every time I use Emacs+Gnus+Planner+BBDB,
<a href="http://www.linkedin.com">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="http://www.openbc.com">OpenBC</a>
or even my
 little black Moleskine notebook and fountain pen, I always find little
 things to improve. I'm in that zone again, and I'm having <b>so</b> much
 fun. Emacs and my Moleskine are nearly infinitely hackable within the
 constraints of computer and paper, respectively. As for LinkedIn and
OpenBC&#x2014;that <b>itch</b> is making me want to write code for someone else.
</p>

<p>
The last time I felt like this was when I was in the thick of Planner
 development, working with a fantastic community of enthusiastic users
 around the world. It was <b>amazing</b> being able to make all these little
 differences in people's lives. I stayed with the project until I found
 myself too content, and then I turned it over to someone else because
 it was something that deserved passion.
</p>

<p>
Maybe I've found my coding passion again, something wider in scope
 than the little ways I customize my blog or my e-mail client or my
 contact database.
</p>

<p>
The more I think about it, the more attractive it is. How strange that
 low-key services like LinkedIn and OpenBC appeal to me more
 than the big names in the industry! I have the feeling that I'll be
 able to make more of a difference there (at least for now) than in
 companies like IBM, Google, or Yahoo &#x2013; although those three are
 certainly exciting in terms of the other cool geeks I'd get to work
 with&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
&#x2026; but oooh, imagine the opportunity to work directly with really
 cool users? I could so totally rock. I'd <b>love</b> to be able to bring my
 technical <b>and</b> social passions to the table. That feels like a good
 short-term next step.
</p>

<p>
Figuring out my options&#x2026;
