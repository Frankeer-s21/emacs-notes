If you have many contacts in another address book program, you can
import them into BBDB. Two popular formats are comma-separated value
files (CSV) and vCard files (VCF).
</p>

<p>
To import a CSV file into BBDB, you will need csv.el from
<a href="http://ulf.epplejasper.de/downloads/csv.el">http://ulf.epplejasper.de/downloads/csv.el</a> and lookout.el from
<a href="http://ulf.epplejasper.de/downloads/lookout.el">http://ulf.epplejasper.de/downloads/lookout.el</a> . Save both files to your
~/elisp directory. Make sure that your ~/elisp directory is in your
load-path by adding the following line to your ~/.emacs:
</p>

<pre class="example">
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/elisp")
</pre>

<p>
Export your contacts as an Outlook-style CSV file, then open the file in
Emacs. After loading the following code, call M-x
wicked/bbdb-import-csv-buffer to merge the CSV data into your address
book. Emacs will try to update existing records based on the e-mail
address or name provided, creating new records if necessary. After Emacs
updates the records, the relevant records are displayed in the <b>BBDB</b>
buffer. Here is the code to make that work:
</p>

<p>
ch6-bbdb-import-csv-buffer.el:
</p>

<pre class="example">

To import a vCard file (VCF) into BBDB, you will need vcard.el from
<a href="http://www.splode.com/~friedman/software/emacs-lisp/src/vcard.el">http://www.splode.com/~friedman/software/emacs-lisp/src/vcard.el</a> and
bbdb-vcard-import.el from
<a href="http://www-pu.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de/users/crestani/downloads/bbdb-vcard-import.el">http://www-pu.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de/users/crestani/downloads/bbdb-vcard-import.el</a>
. By default, these files allow you to import names and e-mail addresses
from vCard files exported from various address book programs. Save
vcard.el and bbdb-vcard-import.el to your ~/elisp directory and add the
following lines to your ~/.emacs:
</p>

<pre class="example">
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/elisp")
(require 'bbdb-vcard-import)
</pre>

<p>
Back up your ~/.bbdb file before calling M-x bbdb-vcard-import to import
a file or M-x bbdb-vcard-import-buffer to import the current buffer.
WARNING: If your vCard file includes fields with multiline values, you
may get silent errors. Verify your import by browsing through the
displayed entries. If some of them have been misread, revert to your
backup ~/.bbdb by closing Emacs and copying your backup over the ~/.bbdb
file. To fix the multi-line error, include the following lines in your
~/.emacs:
</p>

<pre class="example">
(defun wicked/vcard-parse-region (beg end &amp;amp;optional filter)
  "Parse the raw vcard data in region, and return an alist representing data.
This function is just like `vcard-parse-string' except that it operates on
a region of the current buffer rather than taking a string as an argument.

  (or filter
      (setq filter 'vcard-standard-filter))
  (let ((case-fold-search t)
        (vcard-data nil)
        (pos (make-marker))
        (newpos (make-marker))
        properties value)

(fset 'vcard-parse-region 'wicked/vcard-parse-region)
</pre>

<p>
Because address book programs don't use standard labels for addresses
and phone numbers, bbdb-vcard-import.el ignores those fields. For
example, Gmail uses the generic field “Label” for address information
and does not use separate fields for city, state, zip code, and country.
While bbdb-snarf.el makes an attempt to extract addresses from plain
text, it seems to be less trouble to export to the Outlook CSV format
instead, or even to type the address in yourself. If you want to import
addresses, see Project XXX: Import a CSV File into BBDB.
</p>

<p>
Here's a partial workaround to enable you to import phone numbers. I
tested this code with vCard files from Gmail and LinkedIn. To try it
out, add the following modifications to your ~/.emacs:
</p>

<pre class="example">
(defun wicked/bbdb-vcard-merge (record)
  "Merge data from vcard interactively into bbdb."
  (let* ((name (bbdb-vcard-values record "fn"))
     (company (bbdb-vcard-values record "org"))
     (net (bbdb-vcard-get-emails record))
     (addrs (bbdb-vcard-get-addresses record))
     (phones (bbdb-vcard-get-phones record))
     (categories (bbdb-vcard-values record "categories"))
     (notes (and (not (string= "" categories))
             (list (cons 'categories categories))))
     ;; TODO: addrs are not yet imported.  To do this right,
     ;; figure out a way to map the several labels to
     ;; `bbdb-default-label-list'.  Note, some phone number
     ;; conversion may break the format of numbers.
     (bbdb-north-american-phone-numbers-p nil)
     (new-record (bbdb-vcard-merge-interactively name
                             company
                             net
                             nil ;; Skip addresses
                             phones ;; Include phones
                             notes)))
    (setq bbdb-vcard-merged-records (append bbdb-vcard-merged-records 
                        (list new-record)))))
;; Replace bbdb-vcard-import.el's definition
(fset 'bbdb-vcard-merge 'wicked/bbdb-vcard-merge)
</pre>

<p>
Evaluate this code or restart Emacs, then call M-x bbdb-import-vcard
again, which should merge phone numbers into your BBDB records.
