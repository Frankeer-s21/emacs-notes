For once, my random Emacs symbol is strangely apropos. There will
 never be enough time in the day, and it's easier for me to say no to
 low-value tasks if I have other things to do. Here are my best-value
 tasks over the next few days:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Prepare for the start of my new job by reflecting on what's worked
for me before and what hasn't, and figure out what I want. If I can
help my manager learn about my strengths and weaknesses, then he'll
be able to manage me more effectively.
</li>
<li>Work on my book. I should be able to complete the Org section if I
just sit down and write. The Planner section can follow a similar
structure. It pays to complete a rough draft of the chapter as early
as possible, because I can get more feedback from beta readers. I
need to give myself permission to skip the parts that I \<sub>really\</sub>_
want to include but for which the code needs to be written
practically from scratch. My job is to show people interesting hacks,
not fill in all the holes or fix all the bugs.
</li>
<li>Connect with my family and catch up on stuff from last week.
</li>
<li>Braindump what I learned from my chat with Ian Irving. Plenty of
nuggets there, and sharing is the best way of thanking him for his
time.
</li>
<li>Do my weekly review. I feel uncomfortable if I don't have time to
reflect and share.
</li>
<li>Build in some quiet time and some relationship time. I don't want
that to get lost in a long list of TODOs clamoring for my attention.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
These are my essentials for this weekend. It's like the way you manage
money: plan for the important stuff first before you spend on luxuries.
