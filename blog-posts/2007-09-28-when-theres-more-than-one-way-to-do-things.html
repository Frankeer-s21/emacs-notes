Writing about Emacs turns out to be difficult. There are so many ways
 to do something. My goal for this book is to show people some of the
 things that are possible and to help people choose. I'm starting to
 feel a little overwhelmed myself, too. The key thing that's making
 this manageable for me is giving myself permission to write snippets
 here and there, leaving the editing and organization to later.
</p>

<p>
I'm currently working on a chapter about planning your day within
 Emacs. It gives me an excuse to poke around Planner and other modules,
 figuring out how to do things. While writing about Planner and
 appointments, I took my first close look at planner-appt. Now I have
 to think: is this better than the way I'm currently keeping track of
 my appointments? Should I switch to it? How do I describe it for
 others? Should I show how to use it together with planner-cyclic?
</p>

<p>
Maybe I just need to stay focused on the reader, instead of on the
 features of the software. What do people want to be able to do? That's
 the key&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Gah. This writing thing is hard. But it'll be worth it&#x2026;
