<p>
Since people found my
<a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/sketchnotes2012">collection of sketchnotes
from 2012</a> handy, I've put together a categorized collection of
sketchnotes from 2013 as well. Enjoy! =)
</p>

<p>
<i>Behind the scenes</i>
</p>

<p>
This was how I made the 2012 collection:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Create a Microsoft Powerpoint presentation. Fill it with high-res
images. Resize and position all the images. Use AutoHotkey to save
myself time and avoid going crazy.
</li>
<li>Create a spreadsheet with titles and page numbers. Add captions with
liberal use of AutoHotkey.
</li>
<li>Create a manual table of contents and link to all the images. Mostly
use AutoHotkey, except for the part where if you create a link to a
slide number that consists of repeated numbers (ex: 55 or 66), you
have to select it a different way, because typing “55″ gets you #51
(and “555″ gets you #52, etc).
</li>
<li>Save as PDF.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
There was a lot of manual fiddling around involved in making that
collection, so I'm experimenting with a different approach that may be
useful. For Sketchnotes 2013, I wanted to see if there were ways I could
simplify the packaging process while enabling people to do other things
with the files.
</p>

<p>
Here's what I did:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>I used Emacs dired-mode's C-x C-q (<code>dired-toggle-read-only</code>) to go
into editable mode, which allowed me to easily edit all the filenames
to include #keywords. I used C-x C-q to save the changes.
</li>
<li>Then I used Emacs dired's % m to select multiple files by regular
expressions and R to move the files into a specified directory.
</li>
<li>Tada! Neatly organized files. I packaged it up as a ZIP and put it on
Gumroad.
</li>
<li>Since Dropbox also allows you to share folders, I created a public
link to the folder that had my organized sketches. That way, people
can download a single directory if they want to, instead of
downloading all 250+ MB.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
It still might be interesting to make a PDF, especially if I can make
one that can be published through something like CreateSpace. More
packaging&#x2026; =)
