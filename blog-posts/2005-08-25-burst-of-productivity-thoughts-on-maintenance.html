It's 9:17 and I'm looking at a neat list of completed planner tasks,
 mainly thanks to Sergey Vlasov's attention to detail and neat
 bugfixing skills. The Planner community has really grown in all
 directions. Practically all the bugfixes and new features come from
 the users themselves; they're really more co-developers. My role as a
 maintainer, then, is more of documenting what's there, helping
 newbies, guiding people through the source code, and hosting the
 thing. Other projects have maintainers who set the project's
 direction. On the other hand, I follow where people go. I really enjoy
 doing that, and it thrills me to no end when I can hack something
 together quickly to fit a particular person's way of working. =) I'm
 not much of a maintainer&#x2014;bugs keep creeping in, new features hardly
 get worked on&#x2014;but I really love working with the community.
\<sub>They're\</sub>_
 the real maintainers, and they're soooooo cool.
