<p>
Feel free to Make This Happen, or get in touch with me if you want to
 hack on this with a Ruby/Rails newbie. =)
</p>

<p>
You know how geeks do \<sub>really\</sub>_ crazy things with their favorite
 applications? Like the way I practically live in Emacs? And the way
 some people practically live in Microsoft Excel? We use applications
 for \<sub>far\</sub>_ more than they were originally imagined to do.
</p>

<p>
So let's help people think out of the box. Let's show them what geeks
 push their applications to do.
</p>

<p>
What would be ultracool?
</p>

<p>
Think of the way <a href="http://www.43things.com">43things</a> lets you say
 you've either done something or you plan to do something. Add a
 software context and support screenshots. For example, you could add
 “Do mail” to your list of things, set “Emacs” as your software, and
 post a screenshot (optional) of Gnus (or even Rmail). Tick a little
 checkbox if you don't mind if people to ask you for help, and add a
 short note about your experience if you want&#x2026; Oooh, and throw
 tagging in there somewhere.
</p>

<p>
Why is this ubercool?
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>You see what other people do with a certain application. (And you
</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>
will begin to appreciate the insane flexibility of the Emacs text
 editor!)
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>You see how other people do something, and maybe even how popular
</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>
something is.
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>You see what friends and similar people use. =)
</li>
</ul>

<p>
I want this. I think it would totally rock. I'm crazier about it than
 the Eclipse snippets project my research supervisor wants me to
 consider. I think we might get all sorts of useful data about geek
 program usage, if we can get people to do this. For example, I'd
 \<sub>love\</sub>_ to find out what other crazy geek things people who have
 similar usage patterns for Emacs might be doing, or what other
 applications they're crazy about&#x2026; For example, I'm crazy about
 Mozilla Firefox&#x2014;but I know people out there are doing even cooler
 things with it!
</p>

<p>
Steal this idea. Run with it. Make it happen. If I can use it for free
 and I can copy my data easily, I'll be one of your first users and
evangelists! =)
</p>

<p>
Tracing the thoughtpath for fun: how did I get to thinking about that?
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Well, I was thinking about Google and how I want to be an evangelist
more than I want to be an engineer.
</li>
<li>Then I thought about evangelism and what I usually get excited
about.
</li>
<li>Which naturally made me think about Emacs.
</li>
<li>So I thought about all the crazy stuff you can do with Emacs.
</li>
<li>And then I thought about Danny O' Brien's lifehacks talk and how
power users do crazy things with applications.
</li>
<li>Which made me wonder what other people are doing with Emacs.
</li>
<li>Which made me want to start a blog (or revive emacstidbits).
</li>
<li>&#x2026; but then I wanted to see \<sub>other\</sub>_ people's stories&#x2026;
</li>
<li>&#x2026; and although some stories are on
<a href="http://www.emacswiki.org"><a href="http://www.emacswiki.org">http://www.emacswiki.org</a></a> , they're
still
 buried in technical information&#x2026;
</li>
<li>&#x2026; so wouldn't it be cool if we could bring those stories out and
make them

<blockquote>
<p>
easy to capture and browse?
</p>
</blockquote>
</li>

<li>Which made me think of other services that did that, like 43things.
</li>
<li>Which gave me that aha! moment!
</li>
</ol>

<p>
N degrees of Sacha Chua's mind. Emacs is my Kevin Bacon. ;)
