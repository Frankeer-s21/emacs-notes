<h1 class="title">A day in a life with Org</h1>
<p>
December 22nd, 2007 -
<a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/p/4527"><a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/p/4527">http://sachachua.com/blog/p/4527</a></a>
</p>

<p>
I spend most of my day working on or near a computer: writing,
 replying to e-mail, making phone calls, and so on. I use Lotus Notes
 for my calendar because people need to be able to check my
 availability for meetings. I use Emacs to keep track of what I need to
 do, because it makes planning my day so much easier.
</p>

<p>
The first thing I do each morning is quickly go through my e-mail
 looking for action items. Instead of leaving them in my mail inbox, I
 create tasks for each of the items in my Org to-do list. I add notes
 so that I don't have to find the e-mails again. I also add other tasks
 that come to mind. I add time estimates whenever I can.
</p>

<p>
This step is also a good time to review my personal objectives and
 proactively set myself some tasks so that I can move towards them. For
 example, if I want to learn more about career growth, I can't wait for
 e-mail from someone else telling me what to do. I have to think of
 something to do, and build time into my day in order to do it. I put
 all those tasks into my task inbox, which is just a header at the
 bottom of my task list, like this:
</p>

<p>
(remove the leading space)
</p>

<pre class="example">
* Inbox
** TODO ....
** TODO ....
</pre>

<p>
Now that I've captured all these tasks, I review my day. What are my
 appointments? What items are due today? I double-check this against
 my official calendar to make sure I haven't missed any
 appointments. After I make sure that the important tasks and
 appointments are there, I start filling in gaps, scheduling some of my
 important-but-not-urgent tasks onto today.
</p>

<p>
After I've decided what to do that day, I review the rest of the
 week. Does my workload look reasonable? Are there upcoming deadlines?
 I try to make sure that all of my inbox items have scheduled dates. I
 also review my list of waiting tasks to see if I need to follow up
 with anyone.
</p>

<p>
After I've gotten the tasks all down and scheduled, it's easy to
 organize them under the appropriate headings. Billable tasks are filed
 under the projects they belong to, and unbilled tasks are categorized
 by how I need to report them and how I organize them into personal
 projects. Organizing tasks into categories AFTER I schedule them means
 less jumping around looking for unscheduled tasks.
</p>

<p>
This process (e-mail scan and daily and weekly overview) takes me
 around 15 minutes, and helps keep me sane.
</p>

<p>
I try to keep my mornings free for creative brainstorming and heavy
 lifting. Once I've reviewed my plans for the day and the week, I pick
 a task and work on it for an hour or so. When I mark the task as
 STARTED (“t” or “C-u t” from the Org agenda view), the clock
 automatically starts ticking. When I mark the task as WAITING or DONE,
 the clock automatically stops. Org timeclocking makes it easier for me
 to report my hours at the end of each week. I can also compare the
 actual times against my estimates, helping me improve my accuracy.
</p>

<p>
This process is my morning ritual: putting tasks into my Org agenda,
 organizing them, reviewing and planning from my calendar, and then
 getting started by working on something useful \<sub>before\</sub>_ I spend time
 catching up with the blogosphere or responding to my mail. It's
 complemented by my afternoon ritual of reviewing my completed tasks
 with the Org agenda logbook and possibly blogging about some lessons
 learned.
</p>

<p>
Here's how you can use Org to do the same, assuming that you've set it
 up already.
</p>

<p>
Morning ritual:
</p>

<p>
<b>Read your e-mail and create tasks.</b> Open your Org file. If it's not yet
in your Org agenda list, add it with C-c [ (org-agenda-file-to-front).
</p>

<p>
You can jump to the end of the file using M-&gt; (end-of-buffer) and
 add tasks just by typing "** TODO " and the task name. If you read
 e-mail in Emacs (and there are plenty of good reasons to do so!), you
 can set up Remember Mode to make it easy to create hyperlinked tasks
 from mail and other sources. Use C-c C-d (org-deadline) to note
 deadlines for the current task, and use C-c C-s (org-schedule) to note
 when a task needs to be done on a certain date.
</p>

<p>
<b>Review your projects and create tasks.</b> Tag projects like this:
</p>

<pre class="example">
** Learn about career options within the company     :PROJECT:
</pre>

<p>
Then you can use a custom agenda view to see your agenda for today, your
projects, and other useful information.
 Here's something you can add to your ~/.emacs:
</p>

<pre class="example">
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c a") 'org-agenda)
(setq org-agenda-custom-commands
      '(("a" "My custom agenda"
     ((org-agenda-list nil nil 1)
      (tags "PROJECT-WAITING")
      (tags-todo "WAITING")
      (tags-todo "-MAYBE")))))
</pre>

<p>
You can then use C-c a a (org-agenda, custom command) to get an overview
of your day/week, your
 current projects, your WAITING tasks, and your active tasks.
</p>

<p>
<b>Review your day.</b> Use C-c a a (org-agenda, custom command) to see
 your appointments for the day, and open your Org file in another
 buffer. Use C-c C-s (org-schedule) in your Org file to schedule some
 of your inbox tasks for the day and some of your tasks for other days
 in the week. You can use Shift-right and Shift-left to reschedule
 tasks from the agenda view. Use "w" in the agenda to switch to a
 weekly view, and "d" to switch to a daily view.
</p>

<p>
If you want to see how your time estimates fit into your workday with
 a load estimate like this:
</p>

<pre class="example">
15.8% load: 90 minutes to be scheduled, 570 minutes free, 480 minutes gap
</pre>

<p>
add estimated number of minutes to your tasks like this:
</p>

<pre class="example">
** TODO 60 Browse through a book
** TODO 15 Scan my RSS feeds
</pre>

<p>
and use the following code in your ~/.emacs:
</p>

<pre class="example">
(defun sacha/org-show-load ()
  "Show my unscheduled time and free time for the day."
  (interactive)
  (let ((time (sacha/org-calculate-free-time
               ;; today
               (calendar-gregorian-from-absolute (time-to-days (current-time)))
               ;; now
               (let* ((now (decode-time))
                      (cur-hour (nth 2 now))

        (setq total-gap (+ (- end-of-day last-timestamp) total-gap)))
    (cons total-unscheduled total-gap))))
</pre>

<p>
Then you can add it to your custom agenda by using this in your
~/.emacs:
</p>

<pre class="example">
;; Change your existing org-agenda-custom-commands
(setq org-agenda-custom-commands
      '(("a" "My custom agenda"
     ((org-agenda-list nil nil 1)
          (sacha/org-agenda-load)    ; ADD THIS LINE
      (tags "PROJECT-WAITING")
      (tags-todo "WAITING")
      (tags-todo "-MAYBE")))))
</pre>

<p>
<b>Organize your inbox.</b> Now that you've scheduled your tasks, move them
 under the appropriate headings. You can use TAB to collapse a task
 into a single line, then C-k (kill-line) to cut it and C-y to paste it
 elsewhere. I like using C-r (isearch-backward) to search for the right
 place in the file.
</p>

<p>
<b>Get to work!</b> You may find it useful to have four states for a task:
TODO, STARTED, WAITING, and DONE.
 It's also handy to type in a note when you mark a task as done. To set
that up, just add the following to the beginning of your Org file:
</p>

<pre class="example">
#+STARTUP: lognotedone
#+SEQ_TODO: TODO STARTED WAITING DONE
</pre>

<p>
Then you can use "t" (org-todo) from the Org agenda view or C-c C-t
 (org-todo) from the Org file to mark a TODO task as STARTED, or to
 move from one state to the other. To move to a specific state (DONE
 from STARTED, for example), either edit it directly or use C-u before
 the org-todo command.
</p>

<p>
Use the following code to automatically clock in when you start a
 task, start a task when you clock in, and clock out of a task when you
 mark it as waiting.
</p>

<pre class="example">
(defun sacha/org-clock-in-if-starting ()
  "Clock in when the task is marked STARTED."
  (when (and (string= state "STARTED")
             (not (string= last-state state)))
    (org-clock-in)))
(add-hook 'org-after-todo-state-change-hook
      'sacha/org-clock-in-if-starting)
(defadvice org-clock-in (after sacha activate)
  "Set this task's status to 'STARTED'."
  (org-todo "STARTED"))

(defun sacha/org-clock-out-if-waiting ()
  "Clock in when the task is marked STARTED."
  (when (and (string= state "WAITING")
             (not (string= last-state state)))
    (org-clock-out)))
(add-hook 'org-after-todo-state-change-hook
      'sacha/org-clock-out-if-waiting)
</pre>

<p>
<b>Review your accomplishments at the end of the day.</b> You can use the
 Org agenda logbook to see all your completed tasks. From an Org agenda
 view such as the custom one you set up for C-c a a, type "l"
 (lowercase L). You can then see your completed TODOs.
</p>

<p>
To review your time usage, you can use C-c C-x C-d (org-clock-display)
 from an Org buffer to see time totals according to the tree, or you
 can add a table to your custom agenda view. Add the following to your
 ~/.emacs:
</p>

<pre class="example">
(defun sacha/org-agenda-clock (match)
  ;; Find out when today is
  (let* ((inhibit-read-only t))
    (goto-char (point-max))
    (org-dblock-write:clocktable
     `(:scope agenda
       :maxlevel 4
       :tstart ,(format-time-string "%Y-%m-%d" (calendar-time-from-absolute (1+ org-starting-day) 0))
       :tend ,(format-time-string "%Y-%m-%d" (calendar-time-from-absolute (+ org-starting-day 2) 0))))))
</pre>

<p>
and then add sacha/org-agenda-clock to your custom agenda in
 org-agenda-custom-commands in your ~/.emacs file, like this:
</p>

<pre class="example">
;; Change your existing org-agenda-custom-commands
(setq org-agenda-custom-commands
      '(("a" "My custom agenda"
     ((org-agenda-list nil nil 1)
          (sacha/org-agenda-load)
          (sacha/org-agenda-clock)    ; Add this line
      (tags "PROJECT-WAITING")
      (tags-todo "WAITING")
      (tags-todo "-MAYBE")))))
</pre>

<p>
You can then use C-c a a (org-agenda, custom command) to see a table
summarizing your clocked-in time for that day.
</p>

<p>
END RESULT: You can add tasks, quickly get an overview of your day and
 week, reschedule tasks until you've got a realistic load, keep track
 of your progress, and review your accomplishments.
</p>

<p>
Org keeps me sane. =) The code above only looks like a lot of
customization, but it's well worth it.
</p>

<p>
Next, I'm going to figure out how to calculate my velocity, or estimated
time divided by actual time taken&#x2026; =)
