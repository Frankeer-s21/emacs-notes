<p>
Last week's plans
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Lab report: Due Friday. Write up results tomorrow, sketch discussion
</li>
</ul>

<p>
We finished the lab report with some time to spare, although the
 discussion part took us a while. Antony's great as a lab partner, and
 working on a lab report in pairs is much more fun than writing parts
 separately.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>DSS: Monday: prepare clustering lab for Weka, prepare new project
</li>
</ul>

<p>
I decided not to go into the clustering features of Weka, focusing
 instead on decision trees. I posted the second project and tried it
 out, so I know that it's pretty straightforward. I had an oops-my-bad
 moment: forgot to tell them about the handouts, so they had a hard
 time following along in the lab. How embarrassing.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Research: collect tagging information in my wiki
</li>
</ul>

<p>
I'm getting into the hang of reading academic papers. I need to step
 up the pace, though, as the end of the term is coming soon.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Enggpsych: Get further sources for powergrid story, revise chapter 4
</li>
</ul>

<p>
I didn't get to work on this. I should concentrate on this paper
 because the end of the term is coming soon, and I'll be very busy
 marking DSS stuff.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Social: Get started on my Christmas cards, make birthday present for
Michael
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Haven't started on the Christmas cards yet. Had fun at Michael's party,
though.
</p>

<p>
Last week's highlights: bonding
</p>

<p>
Last week was all about having fun with people. Ubuntu talk on
 Tuesday, breakfast on Wednesday, meeting Wednesday night, roommates
 party Thursday night and Friday night, and Mike's party on Saturday
 night&#x2014;wow!
</p>

<p>
It wasn't all play, though. ;) I got into the rhythm of reading
 papers, and the bookmarklet I wrote for posting stuff to my research
 wiki was useful. Labs for the decision support systems class were hard
 to prepare, but I'm surviving somehow. I wrote a lot: a lab report, a
 couple of quick reflections, Planner newbie guides, and two
 <a href="http://sachachua.com/notebook/wiki/ShortStories">ShortStories</a>. I'm
getting there!
</p>

<p>
Plans for next week
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>DSS: Show very basic JESS demo, which I practiced already. Check
projects. (Argh.)
</li>
<li>Research: Read 10 more papers and then start drafting my reading
paper.
</li>
<li>Engg psych: Look up sources for the powergrid story and make an
outline for my paper.
</li>
<li>Social: Temporarily on hold. May get around to Christmas letter.
</li>
<li>Toastmasters: Speech #7 about becoming an expert
</li>
</ul>
