<p>
In October 2006, I gave a short presentation on Livin' la Vida Emacs (or
the Emacs editor as a way of life). It was well-received&#x2014;in fact, so
well-received that folks in the audience anticipated my punchlines and I
ended up shifting parts of my talk around. ;)

<p>
Last, and certainly not least was Sacha Chua. If we could harness it
I'm pretty sure we could power a few small cities of the energy that's
contained in this one, tiny person &#x2013; especially when you get her
talking about Emacs. Sacha's demo, entitled, “Livin' la vida Emacs”
was hands down the most entertaining of the evening. Sacha has
basically taken this simple, extendable text editor and pushed it
about as far as it can go &#x2013; at DemoCamp10 she pulled back the curtain
and showed us all her little systems and apps she's created in it. I
like my GUI/Windows so the whole text-based thing isn't for me but it
certainly was interesting to see just how strung out she's got that
machine.

Sacha Chua showed off what can be done in the scriptable environment,
in this case emacs, as she went from Text editor, to a.i. doctor, to
game engine to task / email organizer and beyond. Sacha was six feet
tall on that stage, even though she did not actual levitate at anytime
(although she came close, as always). A Tour de force of the Emacs, a
text editing tool built in a interpreted lisp language environment,
bascially a personalized productivity platform which allows for
massive customization. Sacha had the crowd entertained and enthralled.
(Sacha blogged her own impressions and mentions that Emacs was
speaking to her!)

Within Toronto's Web community, Sacha Chua has become one of the
leading “personalities”. Armed with infectious enthusiasm, charm and
smarts, she would be an excellent person to hire once she graduates
from UoT. The key question is how best to use her talents. It would
probably be as a customer service rep, who can come into a bad
situation and get everyone happy by the time she leaves. If I was an
HR person from Microsoft, IBM, etc. I'd be knocking on Sacha's door
ASAP.

Why? Probably because in addition to my natural sugar high, I was also
presenting something that was awesomely, arcanely geeky. =)
</p>

<p>
I hadn't figured out how to make a screencast on Linux, so the actual
display on my screen is lost to time. I do, however, have the source
code that I used to step through my speech&#x2013;including speaking cues, as
I didn't want to mess up the presentation in front of Toronto's
technorati! So here's the
<a href="http://sachachua.com/notebook/emacs/democamp.el">source code</a>, for
your amusement. I set up two of my function keys to go forward and
backward, executing the parenthesized expressions. I also set up a
hidden window that could handle my speaking cues so that Emacs could
remind me what the next “slide” was before I transitioned to it, for
smoother flow. <code>emacspeak-speak-buffer</code> is a function that reads the
current window's text using the Emacspeak speech interface with the
Festival synthesizer I'd configured. At some point, I switched to a more
interactive demo, but I still had the speaking cues remind me of the
sequence. So yes, Emacs really was telling me what to say. ;)

<p>
I love pushing the envelope. I love getting to know my tools inside and
out (I enjoy reading source code!) and then making them do things other
people can't imagine. I love tweaking processes in real life, too,
making them better and better every time. That's just part of the way I
<del>work</del> have fun. =)

How can you rock your next technical demo?
