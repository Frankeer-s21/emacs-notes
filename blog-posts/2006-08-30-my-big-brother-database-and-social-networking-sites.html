Yes, I keep a database on people. ;) I use an Emacs module aptly
 called the Big Brother Database (BBDB), which is just a keystroke away
 from my mail (Gnus) and my blog (Planner). I keep all sorts of notes
 in it, like when I met someone or what their food preferences are.
</p>

<p>
The following bit of Emacs Lisp code extracts all the names and e-mail
 addresses from my BBDB. I have 1852 distinct e-mail addresses,
 although a number of them are not for people.
</p>

<pre class="example">
(mapc
 (lambda (rec)
   (if (bbdb-record-net rec)
       (let ((name (bbdb-record-name rec)))
         (mapc
          (lambda (addr)
            (insert name "\t" addr "\n"))
          (bbdb-record-net rec)))))
 (bbdb-records))
</pre>

<p>
I uploaded the list to <a href="http://www.linkedin.com">LinkedIn</a> and
 <a href="http://www.openbc.com">OpenBC</a>, my two favorite business networking
 sites. I found that a lot of my contacts had joined the services since
 I last checked. It was great being able to refer to my notes and make
 those connections. For example, one record said that I'd met someone
 in 2004 at a Tokyo Linux Users Group meeting &#x2013; something I'd probably
 not have remembered on my own&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Some of the records didn't have much annotation aside from the note
 “personal mail”, which means I probably should set up mail indexing
 and search again. Hmm.
</p>

<p>
It's nice to have these notes at my fingertips.
