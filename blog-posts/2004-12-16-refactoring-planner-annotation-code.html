<p>
Many planner files just contain code for creating hyperlinks from the
 current buffer. This does not have anything to do with the idea of
 planning, but simply makes planning information available from more
 buffers.
</p>

<p>
If we separate this functionality from planner.el, we can make it
 easier for people to play around with context-sensitive hyperlinking
 without having to deal with planner's complexity.
</p>

<p>
To make it easy for other people to play around with this, the
 composition function needs to be flexible. Annotations should be
 returned as (uri text) pairs, and a -composition-function can put the
 two together in the appropriate format, escaping as necessary.
 Highlighting will be provided in a separate file that defines a minor
 mode that can be placed anywhere.
</p>

<p>
Other people's code for creating annotations, then, would just involve
 calling -get-uri, or -as-kill, or -to-string. We can use the hook
 mechanism to get the appropriate annotations for the current buffer.
 -core.el will provide a method for resolving links, and it should be
 something that can be used as browse-url-browser-function.
</p>

<p>
planner code also specifies how to mark up links. If we're moving the
 annotation code into a layer that doesn't know about publishing, what
 will happen to the code? In that case, we will define URL
 transformation functions in either emacs-wiki or planner. Yes, that
 would work&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
I need to think of a good name for it. uri.el? Yeah, that sounds okay.
