<p>
We reviewed all the grammatical structures taken up over the last 25
 chapters. I found grammar easy to remember. I think it's because I
 remember patterns well. That's probably why I can pull almost-random
 information out of my head. On the other hand, I have a hard time
 remembering details, so I'll need to revise a lot for my kanji test on
 Monday afternoon.
</p>

<p>
After lunch, I got several bug closes back from happy Planner users.
 I just love it when that happens. =)
</p>

<p>
I also e-mailed someone with Japanese page about emacs-wiki. I told
 him about the change of maintainers and the new way of getting
 versions. =) It was a good opportunity to practice translation, and
 I'm slowly getting the hang of it. I love practicing with
 documentation of my own software&#x2026; ;)
</p>

<p>
I met some people from <a href="http://www.msinet.co.jp">my host company</a>
 this afternoon. Apparently, there aren't a lot of Linux projects these
 days, so they're changing our training program. I'll be learning
 Delphi instead. That should make Ranulf quite happy. I'm looking
 forward to learning Delphi. =) (It's a heck of a lot better than
 working with VB, and there's always Kylix for us Linux geeks&#x2026;)
</p>

<p>
Managed to survive using Japanese. Understood most of what they said.
 Way, way, cool.
</p>

<p>
Practiced poi. Took video of what I think might be a fountain. Video
 will be uploaded to
<a href="http://www.adphoto.com.ph/sacha/"><a href="http://www.adphoto.com.ph/sacha/">http://www.adphoto.com.ph/sacha/</a></a>
eventually.
 (Probably today.)
</p>

<p>
Tonight is planner packaging night. After that, I'm going to upload my
 poi videos and relax before tomorrow's cramming session.
