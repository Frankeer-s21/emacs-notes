Most editors treat everyone the same. Emacs, on the other hand, becomes
 uniquely yours &#x2013; tamed, like the fox in The Little Prince. Let me
paraphrase:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
“No,” said the little prince. “I am looking for friends. What does
 that mean&#x2014;'customize'?”
</p>

<p>
“It is an act too often neglected,” said Emacs. “It means to
 establish ties.”
</p>

<p>
“‘To establish ties'?”
</p>

<p>
“Just that,” said Emacs. “To me, you are still nothing more than a
 user who is just like a hundred thousand other users. And I have no
 need of you. And you, on your part, have no need of me. To you, I am
 nothing more than a editor like a hundred thousand other editors. But
 if you customize me, then we shall need each other. To me, you will
be
 unique in all the world. To you, I shall be unique in all the
 world&#x2026;”
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
And that is why I like Emacs. It may not be the perfect editor, but
 it's \<sub>mine</sub>.\_ =)
