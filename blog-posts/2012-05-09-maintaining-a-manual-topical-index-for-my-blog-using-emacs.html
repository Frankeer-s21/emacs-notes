<p>
I've been blogging for almost ten years. I started with notes from my
university classes and snippets of open source code, and became
comfortable enough to share decisions I'm puzzling through and things
I'm learning about life. There's a lot of stuff in my archive, and I
want to be able to review things again.
</p>

<p>
Categories would probably make this easier, but I use categories
liberally and sometimes inconsistently. I use them like tags, quick
keywords that I add so that people might explore a category and bump
into other posts. I probably should split it out so that I assign posts
to one category and leave everything else as tags. Someday.
</p>

<p>
In the meantime, it's easy enough to maintain a manual
<a href="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/3968124/blog.html">topical index</a> of my blog
posts, and it's a good opportunity to review what I've been writing as
well.
</p>

<p>
I use Emacs <a href="http://orgmode.org/">Org Mode</a> to manage a large text
file divided into headings. Every month, I copy a list of titles into my
topical index. I hacked Org-friendly output into my WordPress theme &#x2013;
you can see <i>April's blog posts</i> as
an example
(<i>sachachua.com/blog/2012/04/?org=1</i>).
I manually organize the list items under different headings, splitting
off new headings when I can see a pattern. Working with two windows
viewing the same buffer makes it easy to move information around, and
<code>org-refile</code> is handy too. I use a checklist structure so that Org can
automatically update the number of posts under each heading
(<code>C-u M-x org-update-statistics-cookies</code>). When I'm happy with the
structure, I use <code>org-publish-current-file</code> to publish it using the
settings I've configured. The files are in my public Dropbox folder, so
they're automatically published to the Web. It takes me about 10 minutes
to add a month of posts to my index and publish the page.
</p>

<p>
I like seeing how much I've written about different topics, and it
encourages me to write and organize more posts. Maybe the index might be
handy for other people too!
