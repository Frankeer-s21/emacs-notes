</p>

<p>
My mom called me in a panic. “I just got this message from info AT
 adphoto.com.ph saying that my e-mail account has been suspended.”
</p>

<p>
I grumbled. Yet another notice. Our e-mail had recently been suspended
 because people weren't deleting their old mail. I had just spent a few
 days with <a href="http://www.ipowerweb.com">ipowerweb</a> tech support and
 <a href="http://www.adphoto.com.ph">Adphoto</a> employees working out the
 issues. Another notice? I was going to track down and scold the errant
 employee.
</p>

<p>
\<sub>After\</sub>_ helping my sister, who paged me to come down so that I could
 help her with the market study along the highway. And meeting my
 friends. And tracking down that planner bug. ARGH!
</p>

<p>
My mom poked her head into the Internet room. “SACHA, fix my e-mail
 now.”
</p>

<p>
Informal tech support people the world over know that when moms use
 that tone of voice, everything else gets bumped down the priority
 list.
</p>

<p>
I trudged over to her Mac and brought up the Ipowerweb help support.
</p>

<p>
Kathy called to follow up. My mom picked up the phone and said,
 “Sacha's here fixing my e-mail.”
</p>

<p>
“No no no, I'm just going to show you how to ask for help. Where's the
 message?”
</p>

<p>
“Why don't you fix it first and then you can teach me how to ask for
 help next time?”
</p>

<p>
“I \<sub>can't\</sub>_ fix it. It's up to the Ipowerweb people. Where's the
 message? Okay. Hmm. Temporarily suspended&#x2026; check account details&#x2026;”
 I didn't catch any typos during my cursory glance, but it didn't feel
 like the other notices we'd gotten from Ipowerweb. The message felt
 wrong. I read further. “Adphoto Support Team&#x2026; Wait a minute, we
 don't \<sub>have\</sub>_ an Adphoto Support Team.” I looked up. Sure enough,
there
 was an attachment named “account-details.zip” just begging to be
opened.
</p>

<p>
“So what's wrong with my e-mail?”
</p>

<p>
“Nothing,” I replied, disgusted. I reread the message. Clever of them
 to work the first part of the domain into the message. “It's one of
 those fake messages with attachments.”
</p>

<p>
“Wait! How do I tell which ones are real and which aren't?”
</p>

<p>
How do I explain that feeling of something being wrong? It's a blink
moment.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Messages that ask you to look at attachments are immediately
suspicious, even if they come from someone you know. Most worms fake
the From: address to be someone you might now. Write the person who
supposedly sent you the message and ask if that's really the
intended attachment.
</li>
<li>Don't click on random links, too. This could open you up to more spam
or attacks that exploit browser vulnerabilities.
</li>
<li>If the message says it comes from an automated system and you
shouldn't bother replying, see if there's a human somewhere you can
get in touch with.
</li>
<li>Tech announcements shouldn't be coming from info AT adphoto.com.ph,
but rather an ipowerweb account. This is particularly true when
they're announcements I don't remember making.
</li>
<li>Make life easier for other people. If you send an attachment or link
to someone else, include enough outside-the-computer information to
let the other person know you're human. For example, you could give
some details about the job just finished.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
I've had to enable e-mail access from the PCs. I've made the employees
 promise not to click on strange links or attachments, and Internet
 access is restricted to a set of government websites and the Adphoto
 website itself. That should provide us with some modicum of protection
 because there's no way for them to establish a direct connection to
 the outside.
</p>

<p>
With social engineers getting cleverer and cleverer, though, will that
 be enough?
