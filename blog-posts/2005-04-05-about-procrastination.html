<h1 class="title">About procrastination</h1>
<p>
April 5th, 2005 -
<a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/p/2698"><a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/p/2698">http://sachachua.com/blog/p/2698</a></a>
</p>

<p>
From <a href="http://www.dictionary.com"><a href="http://www.dictionary.com">http://www.dictionary.com</a></a> :
</p>

<p>
pro-cras-ti-nate
</p>

<p>
(v. intr.) To put off doing something, especially out of habitual
carelessness or laziness.
</p>

<p>
(v. tr.) To postpone or delay needlessly.
</p>

<p>
<b>Procrastination</b> might not be the best word to advertise so
 prominently on the wikiblog of <b>personal information management</b>
 software maintainer, what with all its negative connotations. After
 all, don't we want software to help us be more productive, not less?
</p>

<p>
So what's with <b>planned procrastination</b>, anyway? I renamed my
 blog from the informative-but-boring “sacha chua &#x2013; wiki” to the
 huh?-and-slightly-less-boring “planned procrastination” on a whim. I
 wanted to mention some kind of planning, but I didn't want to project
 myself as some kind of productivity guru. At least, not yet.
</p>

<p>
Besides, what's wrong with the word “procrastination”? I joke about
 <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/PlannerMode">PlannerMode</a>
 being the best procrastination tool I've ever used. When I think about
 it, though, <b>that's</b> why I like it so much. Planner doesn't force
 a particular way of thinking on me. It doesn't bury me under a list of
 urgent TODOs that must! be! done! today! Planner simply lets me get
 things out of my head so that I can rest assured knowing that things I
 plan to do someday won't slip through the cracks of my memory.
</p>

<p>
Sure, a lot of self-help books tell you to <b>stop procrastinating and
 do things now.</b> I might be one of the rare people <b>not</b>
 bothered by the idea that I procrastinate. I keep ideas simmering on
 the backburner, ready for lazy afternoons or moments of inspiration in
 the bath. My procrastination is a gleeful exercise of power over my
 life, making space for other unplanned things. I don't mind putting
 things off until tomorrow if there are unexpectedly wonderful things
 going on today. =)
</p>

<p>
Note that this doesn't mean I'll put off doing things until the
 absolute last minute. In fact, I enjoy doing things with time limits
 as soon as I can, and I often submitted programming assignments soon
 after they were given. I once majorly freaked out when one of my group
 projects was delayed not because of my part (which I had finished
 weeks before) but because the other group members hadn't even started
 on their documentation until the day before (or something like
 that)&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
For me, procrastination is simply the ability to choose what I'd like
 to work on today, knowing that I can work on other things tomorrow or
 the next day or the day after that. It's not perfect, but it does give
 me a happy feeling about how much I accomplish each day and excitement
 about what I'm going to do tomorrow.
</p>

<p>
I'm looking for a stronger title. “productively procrastinating”?
 “structured procrastination”? Something that doesn't mention
 procrastinating but still manages to express this idea? =) Any
 suggestions?
