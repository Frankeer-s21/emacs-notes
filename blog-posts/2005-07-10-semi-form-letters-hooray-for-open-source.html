</p>

<p>
I needed to write 31 thank-you-for-attending-my-send-off-party e-mail
 messages. Instead of having a generic letter that I'd send to lots of
 people all listed in To: or Bcc:, I decided to personalize it a bit by
 including their nicknames, two-year goals, and a personal message I'd
 add to each letter in different places.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately, my mail client was up to the task. One of the benefits of
 having both your contact information and your mail client in an
 easily-programmable environment is that you can hack together a quick
 program to do exactly what you want.
</p>

<p>
I had typed everyone's two-year-plans into my contact information
 manager's Notes field following a special format. It was the work of a
 few minutes to record and run a macro that extracted the data and
 created a signature for each person who attended my send-off party.
</p>

<p>
I then wrote a couple of short functions that looped over the
 currently displayed contact records and drafted messages for each of
 them following a template.
</p>

<p>
This resulted in 31 drafts I could edit and send without hassles. Much
 fun!
</p>

<p>
For future reference (and for the handful of Emacs geeks or learners
 in the audience), here's the code I used to make it all happen:
</p>

<pre class="example">
(defun sacha/bbdb-send-form-mail (bbdb-record &amp;optional subject template)
  "Compose a form message to the people indicated by the current BBDB record(s)."
  (interactive (list (if (bbdb-do-all-records-p)
                         (mapcar 'car bbdb-records)
                       (bbdb-current-record))
                     (read-string "Subject: ")
                     (read-string "Template (): ")))
  (if (consp bbdb-record)
      (let ((records bbdb-record))
        (while records
          (sacha/bbdb-send-form-mail-1 (car records) subject template)
          (setq records (cdr records))))
    (sacha/bbdb-send-form-mail-1 bbdb-record subject template)))

(defun sacha/bbdb-send-form-mail-1  (bbdb-record &amp;optional subject template)
  "Compose a form message for one person."
    (if bbdb-inside-electric-display
      (bbdb-electric-throw-to-execute
       (list 'sacha/bbdb-send-form-mail bbdb-record subject)))
  ;; else...
  (cond ((null bbdb-record) (error "record unexists"))
        ((null (bbdb-record-net bbdb-record))
         (message "%s record unhas a network addresses." (or (bbdb-record-name bbdb-record) "Unknown")))
        (t (bbdb-send-mail-internal (bbdb-dwim-net-address bbdb-record)
                                    subject (list bbdb-record))
           (goto-char (point-min))
           (when (re-search-forward "--text follows this line--" nil t)
             (forward-line 1)
             (insert template)
             (goto-char (point-min))
             (while (search-forward "" nil t)
               (replace-match (or (bbdb-record-getprop bbdb-record 'nick)
                                  (bbdb-record-name bbdb-record))
                              t t))
             (when (bbdb-record-getprop bbdb-record 'signature)
               (goto-char (point-max))
               (insert "\n")
               (let ((p (point)))
                 (insert (bbdb-record-getprop bbdb-record 'signature))
                 (fill-region-as-paragraph p (point))))
             (goto-char (point-min))
             (if (re-search-forward "^Subject: $" nil t) (end-of-line))))))
</pre>

<p>
I used M-x local-set-key to bind sacha/bbdb-send-form-mail to M. * M
 then applies the function to all displayed records.

<a href="http://sachachua.com/notebook/emacs/miniedit.el">../emacs/miniedit.el</a>
makes it easy to edit long strings in the
 minibuffer, and that made the template much easier to write.
</p>

<p>
Emacs totally rocks. Nothing else has ever given me this much power.
