<p>
The dreaded white screen of nothingness usually means that I've
misplaced a quotation mark or brace somewhere in my PHP code. On-the-fly
syntax checking in Eclipse helped me find those errors quickly because I
could scan the right scrollbar for areas marked with red. I knew that
shifting to Emacs wouldn't automatically cure me of the propensity to
mismatch my parentheses. If I could get on-the-fly syntax checking
working in Emacs, I'd save myself a lot of time.
</p>

<p>
It took me a while to sort out various configuration problems. Most were
due to the fact that PHP didn't report parse errors with my original
configuration, even though I had uncommented the line after “Show only
errors”. As it turned out, the error\<sub>reporting</sub> option in php.ini needs
to include E\<sub>PARSE</sub> in order for php to report parsing error details.
Here's the value I'm currently using in /etc/php.ini:
</p>

<pre class="example">
error_reporting = E_ERROR|E_COMPILE_ERROR|E_CORE_ERROR|E_PARSE
</pre>

<p>
Flymake is the package responsible for on-the-fly syntax checking in
Emacs. Out of the box, it supports C, C++, XML, XHTML, Perl, Java, TeX,
and IDL. To load Flymake and add support for PHP, add the following to
your ~/.emacs:
</p>

<pre class="example">
(require 'flymake)

(defun flymake-php-init ()
  "Use php to check the syntax of the current file."
  (let* ((temp (flymake-init-create-temp-buffer-copy 'flymake-create-temp-inplace))
     (local (file-relative-name temp (file-name-directory buffer-file-name))))
    (list "php" (list "-f" local "-l"))))

(add-to-list 'flymake-err-line-patterns 
  '("\\(Parse\\|Fatal\\) error: +\\(.*?\\) in \\(.*?\\) on line \\([0-9]+\\)$" 3 4 nil 2))

(add-to-list 'flymake-allowed-file-name-masks '("\\.php$" flymake-php-init))

;; Drupal-type extensions
(add-to-list 'flymake-allowed-file-name-masks '("\\.module$" flymake-php-init))
(add-to-list 'flymake-allowed-file-name-masks '("\\.install$" flymake-php-init))
(add-to-list 'flymake-allowed-file-name-masks '("\\.inc$" flymake-php-init))
(add-to-list 'flymake-allowed-file-name-masks '("\\.engine$" flymake-php-init))

(add-hook 'php-mode-hook (lambda () (flymake-mode 1)))
(define-key php-mode-map '[M-S-up] 'flymake-goto-prev-error)
(define-key php-mode-map '[M-S-down] 'flymake-goto-next-error)
</pre>

<p>
Evaluate that code, open one of your PHP files, and intentionally break
it. The syntax error should be highlighted. To change the highlighting,
move your point to the error and type M-x customize-face. Accept the
default (flymake-errline), then customize it as desired. Don't forget to
save your customizations for future sessions.
</p>

<p>
If your syntax errors are not highlighted and you get a message like
this:
</p>

<pre class="example">
Configuration error occured while running (php -f test_flymake.php -l). flymake will be switched OFF
</pre>

<p>
double-check your /etc/php.ini to make sure that E\<sub>PARSE</sub> is included as
one of the options for error\<sub>reporting</sub>. You can check the output by
running php -f <i>yourfile.php</i> -l. You should see the line number of the
parse error. Make sure that this matches the regular expression added to
flymake-err-line-patterns in your ~/.emacs. If your PHP returns a
slightly different message, modify your flymake-err-line-patterns
accordingly.
</p>

<p>
Flymake can save you a lot of programmer frustration for the cost of a
little CPU time. Use it to check for errors before you save files or
commit them to your source code control repository, and you and other
developers will be much happier.
</p>
