From Jan Alonzo:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
I think the reason why I mentioned “Planning the Unplanned” is because
we plan
 (and prioritize) the stuff we want to do for the day, analyse it, and
see how
 much “procrastination time” we have for that day. By looking at your
tasks,
 you kinda think “Oh I've got a bit of \<sub>space\</sub>_ here, let's read some
email.
 That sort of thing. Well, at least, that's how I think anyway :-).

<p>
Hehehe. M-x plan. I like it as a title for your blog. Very appropriate
</p>
<p>
:D

From Gerd Flaig:

<p>
How do you like the term ‘agile planning'?

From Paul Lussier:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Just read your blog on procrastination. It might amuse you to know
 that I coined the term (with my best friend Celeste) “Productive
 Procrastination” over 15 years ago! :)
</p>

<p>
I'm sure we weren't the first to come up with, what with me being one
 of the wholly most un-original people on this planet. But Celeste and
 I would constantly “help” each other “productively procrastinate” on
a
 regular basis. The definition of “Productive Procrastination” is:
</p>

<p>
#+BEGIN<sub>QUOTE</sub>
  The avoidance of doing something mostly uninteresting by doing
   something else which also legitimately needs to be accomplished,
  but
   probably not nearly as urgently as that task which you are
   attempting to avoid.

<p>
Often times this would be in the form of studying for one class in
 order to avoid studying for another. Or working on a CS project which
 was due soon, but not nearly as soon as the impending calculus exam
</p>
<p>
:)
 Just today infact, I avoided building 2 Windows laptops by figuring
 out how to extend planner! I'm sure you get the point&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
I've recently (in the past year or so) come across another term for my
 “Productive Procrastination”:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Shaving the Yak
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
as defined here:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<a href="http://www.ai.mit.edu/lab/gsb/gsb-archive/gsb2000-02-11.html"><a href="http://www.ai.mit.edu/lab/gsb/gsb-archive/gsb2000-02-11.html">http://www.ai.mit.edu/lab/gsb/gsb-archive/gsb2000-02-11.html</a></a>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
  So, you have my vote in favor of using “Productive Procrastination” as
   your wiki title :)

<p>
Hey, that sounds like structured procrastination, mentioned by an
 essay I read a year ago or so&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Mmkay, let's try “productively procrastinating”. (Title of the day!)
