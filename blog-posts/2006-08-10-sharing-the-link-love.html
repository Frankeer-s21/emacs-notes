<h1 class="title">Sharing the link love</h1>
<p>
August 10th, 2006 -
<a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/p/3747"><a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/p/3747">http://sachachua.com/blog/p/3747</a></a>
</p>

<p>
People who visit my <a href="http://sachachua.com">blog</a> instead of reading
 it on an RSS aggregator get a couple of nifty extras, including my
 task list and a list of e-mail messages sent. It's a personal
 experiment I've been running for a while now with unexpectedly
 positive results. People have helped me with things on my task list,
 and my sent mail list resulted in reminders from two people who
 noticed that they hadn't received some messages listed as sent&#x2014;the
 messages had gotten stuck in my mail queue.
</p>

<p>
These things are easy for me to track because I use
 <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/PlannerMode">Planner</a>, an
 insanely customizable personal information manager for the Emacs text
 editor. Today I realized that my list of sent e-mail is a good way to
 share the link love and direct you to the websites of the people I
 talk to, so I added a bit of code to my config.
</p>

<p>
On my computer, “E-mail to” is hyperlinked to the actual e-mail, and
 names are hyperlinked to their contact records. On the Web, “E-mail
 to” is not a hyperlink, and names are hyperlinked to people's blogs or
 websites.
</p>

<p>
It's a little tweak, but who knows what it'll lead to? If you end up
 discovering an interesting person through this, way cool. And hey, it
 gives people whom I write extra Google juice&#x2026; =)
</p>

<p>
I might do the same for the tasks, although that requires a teensy bit
 more coding. Hmm.
</p>

<p>
I'm thinking of listing the subject header again. It'll give people
 more of an idea of what other people talk to me about.
 Dan Howard was concerned about privacy. I
 occasionally delete subjects if I think they're sensitive. Do you
 think I might get away with a mostly opt-out system?
</p>

<p>
Anyway, check out my actual <a href="http://sachachua.com">blog</a> every now and
then! =)

        (planner-seek-to-first "E-mail sent")

  nil)

          (lambda ()
            (add-hook 'message-sent-hook 'sacha/planner-gnus-track-sent)))
