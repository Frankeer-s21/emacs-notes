<p>
I'm in London for <a href="http://emacsconf.org">Emacs Conference 2013</a>
(squee!!), which is tomorrow. John Wiegley and I are starting the day
off with a whirlwind tour of Emacs' past, present, and future. The
program looks excellent, and I can't wait to learn from all these
wonderful people. Let's find out what sketchnotes of an extremely geeky
conference look like! =D
</p>

<p>
I'd worked on this presentation about 9 hours before leaving for London.
I wrote most of the
<a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3968124/sacha-emacs.html#emacsconf2013">presentation
code</a> on the airplane (functions to go forward and backward, and to
process the current slide).
</p>

<p>
I finished the rest of the content this morning, then headed out with
Alex and his wife Tina. Today I got to experience a slice of regular
life over here: a walk through the market, a grocery trip, a yummy
home-cooked meal. Alex and Tina have been fantastic hosts! =)
</p>

<p>
After dinner, I worked a little more on the presentation. I made slides
and a PDF just in case my Org presentation doesn't work out, and helped
with nametags and the list of people attending.
</p>

<p>
I'm looking forward to the conference. I think this will be an excellent
adventure! I'll post my presentation afterwards, so subscribe to my blog
or follow the <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=emacsconf">#emacsconf</a>
hashtag. If you're attending tomorrow, come and say hi! I'll be the
short Asian girl bouncing around and possibly hyperventilating at all
the awesomeness. I'll also be drawing sketchnotes on a tablet PC,
assuming I don't give up and stick everything into org-capture instead.
=)
