<p>
Organizing your tasks into projects can help you plan ahead, track
 your progress, and stay motivated. Working from a project list allows
 you to plan your day or week instead of just reacting to other
 people's requests. Keeping your projects and tasks in Org makes it
 easier for you to review your completed tasks and plan the next step.
 If you include some text describing why you want to do the project and
 what your intended outcome is, this can help you stay motivated
 throughout a long project.
</p>

<p>
Projects can take a single day or several years. They can be large
 projects involving lots of other people and resources, or small
 projects that you do on your own. Projects may involve a handful of
 separate steps or a hundred things you need to do in order to achieve
 your goal. The important thing is that there is more than one step.
 If you organize your task list so that related tasks are together,
 then you'll find it easier to get a sense of where you are, where
 you're going, and what you need to do next.
</p>

<p>
In this section, you will learn how to:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Create projects,
</li>
<li>Organize your tasks into projects,
</li>
<li>Review your ongoing projects, and
</li>
<li>Mark projects as finished.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
I'll assume that you're using Emacs 22, and that you've set up Org
 using an ~/organizer.org agenda file and the basic configuration
 suggested in either “Org and GTD” or “Org as a Day Planner.” I'll also
 assume that you're familiar with switching between the Org agenda view
 and the Org organizer file, and that you're comfortable navigating
 around Emacs.
</p>

<p>
The examples I'll use focus on yearly goals. You might also have
 short-term projects or long-term plans. Feel free to adapt the
 examples as needed.
</p>

<p>
Open your ~/organizer.org file. If you've collected your tasks as
 suggested in the previous sections on Using Org as a Day Planner or
 Using Org for GTD, your ~/organizer.org file might look something like
 this:
</p>

<pre class="example">
* Inbox
** TODO Read Emacs Lisp intro
** TODO Write yearly review
** TODO Exercise
** TODO Browse the Emacs Wiki
</pre>

<p>
Create new top-level headings for this year's goals or the projects
 that you're working on. You can create a top-level heading by
 typing * and the heading, like this:
</p>

<pre class="example">
* Learn more about Emacs
* Go on vacation
...
* Inbox
** TODO Read Emacs manual
...
</pre>

<p>
It's a good idea to add the projects to the beginning of the file
 (before your Inbox) because M-x remember adds new tasks or notes to
 the end of the file. If the last major heading as * Inbox, then the
 tasks and notes are automatically added to it. If the last major
 heading is a project, the tasks and notes may get misfiled.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-1">What are your projects?</h3>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-2">Yearly goals? I've got twenty-year plans!</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">
<p>
If you're a top-down planner, you'll find it easy to list your
 projects. In fact, you might have a ten- or even twenty-year plan
 already written down. You'll find this section straightforward,
 because you're already used to planning in terms of projects.
 Go ahead and adapt the examples to your long-term plans.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-3">Yearly goals? I live day by day!</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-3">
<p>
If you're a bottom-up planner, you might be giving me a weird look
 right now. “Yearly goals? I'm lucky if I can figure out how to get
 through the next day!” This section will also show you how to find the
 recurring themes in your task list and organize them into projects.
 Give project-based planning a try for a month. If this way of thinking
 doesn't work for you, Org will work just fine without projects.
</p>

<p>
You probably have projects, even if you can't think of any right
 now. Review your ~/organizer.org file. If you haven't written down
 everything you needed to do yet, go through the section on basic
 configuration for your planning style (GTD or day planning). Once you
 have a list of things to do, you can then review it for big tasks,
 related tasks, and other project clues.
</p>

<p>
Read your tasks and ask yourself the following questions:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Can I do this in one sitting?</b> Big tasks such as “Write a book” are
often projects in disguise. Use projects so that you can break them
down into smaller, doable tasks.
</li>
<li><b>Is this related to other tasks?</b> Related tasks such as “Book a
flight” and “Plan my itinerary” are often clues to a project like “Go
on vacation”. Use projects so that you can review related tasks
together.
</li>
<li><b>Why am I doing this?</b> When you think about the reason why you're
doing something, you'll often find a bigger project. For example, if
one of your tasks is “Set up an automatic retirement savings plan”,
then the question “Why am I doing this?” may lead you to the project
“Plan for retirement”. Use projects to help you think of other ways
to move towards that goal.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Big tasks need to be broken down into smaller tasks anyway, and
 organizing them into projects will help you make them more
 manageable. You may not want to organize all of your other tasks into
 projects. If you can pick some major themes to focus on, though, then
 you'll be able to see how the different things you do are related to
 each other, and you'll be able to think of other ways to work on those
 projects. If you're starting out with project-based thinking, maybe
 you can pick three to five projects and try to do a little work on
 each of them every day.
</p>

<p>
If you still don't identify any projects, that's okay. You can use Org
 as a straightforward task list. Jump ahead to the section on “Tags”,
 as you'll probably find that useful.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, if this step turns up plenty of projects, resist
 the temptation to over-correct and end up with hundreds of projects. I
 find that more than 7 active projects gets hard to manage. Pick a few
 main themes that you'd like to work on, and make everthing else
 something you plan to do someday.
</p>

<h3 id="sec-2-1">Creating tasks</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">
<p>
Now that you have project headings, think of the next thing you need
 to do in order to move those projects forward. If you've already
 written down those tasks, move them under the appropriate project
 heading. If not, type them in.
</p>

<p>
In order for a task to belong to a project, it needs to be under the
 heading and at a lower level. For example, if your project heading has
 one star, like this:
</p>

<pre class="example">
* Learn Emacs
</pre>

<p>
then your TODO headings should have two stars, like this:
</p>

<pre class="example">
* Learn Emacs
** TODO Read the Emacs manual
** TODO Read the Emacs Lisp Intro manual (eintr)
** TODO Install the Emacs source code
</pre>

<p>
If your tasks are not at the right level, you can add the star
 manually by editing the heading. You can also use M-right and M-left
 (org-metaright and org-metaleft) while on a heading in order to
 promote or demote it, and you can use M-S-right and M-S-left
 (org-shift-metaright and org-shift-metaleft) to promote or demote
 entire subtrees.
</p>

<p>
To move tasks up and down within the project, you can copy and paste
 the text. You can use M-Up and M-Down (org-metaup and org-metadown) to
 move subtrees.
</p>

<p>
Think of tasks you can do within the next week in order to move each
 of your projects forward. Add next actions to all of your active
 projects. Creating next actions for each of your projects makes it
 easier to remember to keep moving forward.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-2">Organizing tasks</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">
<p>
If you have many tasks in a project, you may want to organize them
 into sub-projects. For example, you might divide a software project
 into components. If you're starting from scratch, you can create the
 project structure by typing in more stars for sub-project
 headings. For example:
</p>

<pre class="example">
* Learn Emacs
** Read mail
*** TODO Choose a mail client
*** TODO Install and configure the mail client
*** TODO Send a message
...
** Browse the Web
*** Read through the w3m documentation
...
</pre>

<p>
You can also demote an existing project into a subproject.
 Use M-S-right (org-shift-metaright) on the
 current project headline in order to demote it to a sub-project. This
 will also demote the tasks within the project. For example, demoting
 this:
</p>

<pre class="example">
* Learn Emacs
** TODO Choose a mail client
** TODO Install and configure the mail client
** TODO Send a message
</pre>

<p>
will result in this:
</p>

<pre class="example">
** Learn Emacs
*** TODO Choose a mail client
*** TODO Install and configure the mail client
*** TODO Send a message
</pre>

<p>
Then you can change the heading and add another heading above it, like
this:
</p>

<pre class="example">
* Learn Emacs
** Read mail
*** TODO Choose a mail client
*** TODO Install and configure the mail client
*** TODO Send a message
</pre>

<p>
This kind of organization is optional, but it can help you get an idea
 of the overall structure of your project. Using different levels
 allows you to hide and show groups of headings by pressing TAB on the
 heading.
</p>

<p>
Now that you've created your project tasks and organized them the way
 you want, it's time to actually do the work.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-3">Working on tasks</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-3">
<p>
If you use Org as a day planner, you may also want to schedule the
 tasks onto specific days with C-c C-s (org-schedule). You can review
 your daily or weekly agenda with C-c a a (org-agenda,
 org-agenda-list), switching between daily and weekly views with d and
 w (org-agenda-day-view and org-agenda-week-view).
</p>

<p>
You can work with the next actions in the same way you work with other
 tasks, rescheduling them or marking them as STARTED, WAITING or DONE
 with the keyboar shortcuts introduced in the previous section on Org
 and GTD or Org as a Day Planner.
</p>

<p>
When you finish a project task, think of the next action you can do in
 order to move that project forward. If you use Org as a day planner,
 schedule the next action onto your calendar as well.
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3">Reviewing projects</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
You can review your projects by opening your ~/organizer.org and
 browsing through the headings. S-tab (org-shifttab) changes the
 visibility of headings, so you can see just the top-level headings or
 all the details. You can use TAB (org-cycle) on a headline to show or
 hide subtrees.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-3-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-3-1">Reviewing a list of projects</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-1">
<p>
If you have many projects, you'll want a shorter view of just your
 active projects. To make it easier to review projects, add a PROJECT
 tag to all your active project headlines. You can add a tag by
 editing your ~/organizer.org and moving your cursor to the headline
 and typing C-c C-c (org-ctrl-c-ctrl-c), followed by the name of the
 tag (PROJECT). You can also manually type :TAGNAME: at the end of the
 headings, like this:
</p>

<pre class="example">
* Learn more about Emacs        :PROJECT:
** TODO Read the Emacs manual
** TODO Read the Emacs Lisp Intro manual (eintr)
...
* Go on vacation                :PROJECT:
...
* Inbox
...
</pre>

<p>
You might classify some of your projects as someday/maybe &#x2013; things
 that are nice to think about, but which you aren't acting on right
 now. Tag your inactive or someday/maybe projects with PROJECT and
 MAYBE. If you're editing the ~/organizer.org file, just
 add :PROJECT:MAYBE: to the heading. If you're tagging it with C-c C-c
 (org-ctrl-c-ctrl-c), specify PROJECT:MAYBE as the tag.
</p>

<pre class="example">
* Learn more about Emacs        :PROJECT:
* Go on vacation                :PROJECT:MAYBE:
...
* Inbox
** TODO Read Emacs manual
...
</pre>

<p>
Now that you've tagged your projects, you can view just your project
 headlines with a custom agenda command. Custom agenda views are a
 terrific feature in Org, and you can do a lot with them if you know a
 little Emacs Lisp. Here's what you need to add to your ~/.emacs in
 order to get a list of your active projects and your someday/maybe
 projects:
</p>

<pre class="example">
(setq org-agenda-custom-commands
      '(("p" tags "PROJECT-MAYBE-DONE" nil)  ;; (1)
        ("m" tags "PROJECT&amp;MAYBE" nil)       ;; (2)
        ;; ... put your other custom commands here
       ))
</pre>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>(1) This makes C-c a p (org-agenda, p) show your active projects.
</li>
<li>(2) This makes C-c a m (org-agenda, m) show your “maybe” projects.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
With these two commands, you can quickly review your active and
 inactive projects. To jump to a project from the agenda view, move
 your cursor to the heading and press RET (org-agenda-switch-to). If
 you want to scan through the projects quickly, use f
 (org-agenda-follow-mode) in the agenda view to turn on follow mode,
 then move to different headlines. Another window will show the
 headline at point.
</p>

<p>
If you review your projects at least once a week, you'll find it
 easier to make regular progress. If you want to combine your
 weekly/daily review with your project list, you can do that with
 org-agenda-custom-commands as well. Here's what you'd put in your
 ~/.emacs:
</p>

<pre class="example">
(setq org-agenda-custom-commands
      '(("p" tags "PROJECT-MAYBE-DONE" nil)
        ("m" tags "PROJECT&amp;MAYBE" nil)
        ("a" "My agenda"                            ;; (1)
         ((org-agenda-list)                         ;; (2)
          (tags "PROJECT-MAYBE-DONE")))             ;; (3)
        ;; ... put your other custom commands here
       ))
</pre>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>(1) The first argument is the shortcut key, the second is a name for
the agenda view
</li>
<li>(2) Your daily or weekly agenda. The d and w (org-agenda-day-view and
org-agenda-week-view) shortcuts work if the point is within this
section
</li>
<li>(3) A list of your active projects
</li>
</ul>

<p>
This configures C-c a a (org-agenda, “My agenda”) to display your
 agenda and a list of your project headings. Again, you can press RET
 (org-agenda-switch-to) to jump to a project from its heading in the
 agenda view.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-3-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-3-2">Reviewing your stuck projects</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-2">
<p>
You might have forgotten to create next actions for some of your
 active projects. Org can help you find projects which don't have next
actions.
 You can then decide if the project is complete or if it needs further
action.
</p>

<p>
To list stuck projects, you first need to tell Org what a stuck
 project is. The following code defines a stuck project as an active
 project (not tagged “maybe” or “done”) that doesn't have a TODO or
 STARTED action, if the body of the project doesn't contain
“*lt;IGNORE&gt;”. Add this to your ~/.emacs and evaluate it:
</p>

<pre class="example">
(setq org-stuck-projects
      '("+PROJECT/-MAYBE-DONE" ("TODO" "STARTED") nil "\\&lt;IGNORE\\&gt;"))
</pre>

<p>
Then you can use M-x org-agenda-list-stuck-projects or C-a a #
 (org-agenda, org-agenda-list-stuck-projects) to show only the stuck
 projects. Review this list and jump to the headlines.
</p>

<p>
Want to add that to your custom agenda view? Modify the
org-agenda-custom-commands value in your ~/.emacs to be like this:
</p>

<pre class="example">
(setq org-agenda-custom-commands
      '(("p" tags "PROJECT-MAYBE-DONE" nil)
        ("m" tags "PROJECT&amp;MAYBE" nil)
        ("a" "My agenda"
         ((org-agenda-list)
          (org-agenda-list-stuck-projects)          ;; (1)
          (tags "PROJECT-MAYBE-DONE")))
        ;; ... put your other custom commands here
       ))
</pre>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>(1) It's a good idea to put it before your regular project list so
that you can see what needs your attention.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
What about finished projects? You might want to keep them in your Org
 file, but they shouldn't show up in your active and inactive project
 lists. Org can keep track of those projects too.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-3-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-3-3">Marking projects as done</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-3">
<p>
If you look at the custom commands above, you'll notice the “-DONE”
 specifier. “DONE” is the tag we'll use to indicate done projects. To
 tag a project as done, move the point to the project heading and type
 C-c C-c (org-ctrl-c-ctrl-c). The tag prompt will default to the
 current tags. Just add “DONE” and press Enter. With the custom
 commands we've set up, projects tagged DONE will not show in your
 active, inactive, or stuck project lists.
</p>

<p>
You can also add the tag manually. For example, if the project heading
is
</p>

<pre class="example">
* Learn Emacs    :PROJECT:
</pre>

<p>
and you're happy with your level of Emacs proficiency, then you can
 mark it as done by changing it to
</p>

<pre class="example">
* Learn Emacs    :PROJECT:DONE:
</pre>

<p>
If you have plenty of completed projects, your Org file might be quite
 large. You can mark a subtree for archiving by typing C-c C-x C-a
 (org-toggle-archive-tag). This hides it from most Org commands. You
 can also archive a tree into a different file with C-c C-x C-s
 (org-advertized-archive-subtree).
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-4">Wrapping up</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
Now you can create projects, manage your project tasks, and review
 your active, inactive, and stuck projects in Org. You know how to mark
 projects as completed and how to archive them. You've also started
 using tags to dynamically generate reports from your Org file.
</p>

<p>
Tags can do a lot more. To find out what else you can do with tags,
 read the next section on “Tagging in Org”.
