(<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/elucid/status/159767393428705280">@elucid</a>)
wanted to use
<a href="https://github.com/nschum/full-ack/blob/master/full-ack.el">full-ack.el</a>
to search through his project files using the Ack tool, but Ack refused
to run because it didn't think his terminal had enough capabilities. A
simple fix was to set the TERM variable with
</p>

<pre class="example">
(setenv "TERM" "xterm")
</pre>

<p>
which told Ack that Emacs was fine with its output.
</p>

<p>
(Speaking of Ack integration &#x2013; This being the Emacs world, there's more
than one way to do things. You might also want to check out
<a href="http://technosorcery.net/blog/2011/04/02/a-better-emacs-front-end-to-ack/">ack-and-a-half.el</a>,
which is midway between ack.el and full-ack.el.)

It was interesting hanging out with someone else who used Emacs, and
being able to share tips. I don't run into many other Emacs geeks, but I
sporadically hang out in the #emacs channel or browse Planet Emacsen to
be inspired. It's funny how many of the meetups I go to end up involving
Emacs conversations. It's like I have a big M-x banner hovering over my
head. =) It's awesome, actually!
