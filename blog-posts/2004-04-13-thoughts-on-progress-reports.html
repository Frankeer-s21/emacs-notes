I personally despise the need to write progress reports in human
 terms &#x2014; mainly I want to show that progress is being made in terms
 of code and functionality. I don't want to put down into writing
 things that I feel about my groupmates, but rather I would like to
 commend them just for their accomplishments. I've just submitted
 one progress report, and I never really liked it. My grade may be
 in jeopardy because of that, but anyway that's how I personally
 feel.

I find I \<sub>like\</sub>_ making progress reports, if only in terms of e-mail to
 the emacs-wiki-discuss mailing list or entries in blog. I like
 summarizing my changes in a changelog and telling people about my
 future plans. Not everyone can glance at code and understand it. Even
 I'd get lost if I had to stare at my diffs to find out what I changed
 when. I think progress reports are a Good Thing.

<p>
In fact, I think they're such a good thing that I want my students to
 do them, even the first year students. I want them to get into the
 habit of reflecting on what they've done, what they've learned, and
 what they still need to learn. I want them to get into the habit of
 mapping out what they want to do and marking out what they've
 accomplished. I want them to explore not only their accomplishments in
 terms of code but their growth in so many other areas, like working
 with groupmates. I want to hear about problems not just at the end but
 throughout the duration of the project.
