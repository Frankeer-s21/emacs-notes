<p>
Objective: Give Prof. Chignell some ideas about Planner so that he can
 introduce me to the wearable computing and personal information
 management research groups.
</p>

<p>
I don't have to convince him to let me do this kind of research for my
 master's. I could use more time to bring out and document different
 usage patterns, anyway. I do want to show him that I care about users
 and I'm good at tweaking things for particular needs, though.
</p>

<p>
Medical handhelds seem very interesting. I don't have to take personal
 information management up for my master's as long as I make sure I
 talk to the people in that group and learn how they do research.
 Medical handhelds would be far more useful to people in the
 Philippines. I should get in touch with Doc Oly as well as the UP
 Manila folks.
</p>

<p>
What points can I highlight that will transfer well to that field?
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Different requirements: interface, functionality.
</li>

<li>Minimizing attention required: context switch, distraction,
</li>
</ul>

<p>
automatic context.
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Evolving functionality based on user feedback. Quick development.
</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>
User-contributed code.

<p>
â€˜course, I'll have to rewrite my
