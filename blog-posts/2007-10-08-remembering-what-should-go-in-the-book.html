<p>
Writing a book about an open source editor and its extensions is
 difficult. I want to describe many of the things people can do in
 order to customize and make the most of Emacs, but I don't want to
 just rewrite the manual. I find myself summarizing a few bits and
 expounding on others.
</p>

<p>
The key thing I want to add to this is excitement. I want people to be
 able to <b>see</b> what these changes result in and how those changes will
 improve their productivity or make them happier. ;) (Tall order for a
 text editor!) I want this book to be less about a laundry list of
 things people can do and more about looking over geeks' shoulders and
 being inspired to hack and learn more. That's the kind of book I want
 to write: a book that makes people go, “You can do that with Emacs?!”
 I want to write a book that convinces people to spend some time
 exploring the limits of their software (even vi!), because hidden
 features can totally rock. I also want to write a book that shows how
 all these little things combined can be absolutely cool, the way my
 Planner+BBDB+Gnus+everything-else combination works out really well
 for me. The whole is more than the sum of its parts.
</p>

<p>
I sometimes find it hard to hang on to that thought when I'm reading
 the user's manual and trying to make sure I'm covering the essentials.
 I find myself writing from the point of view of the software instead
 of from the point of view of the user. What I need to do is to focus
 on the user's story, on the problem or idea or opportunity. <b>Then</b> I
 can write about solutions for that. I think I need to change the
 outline I'm working with&#x2014;it's too software-centric.
</p>

<p>
It doesn't have to be a perfect book, but I want it to be exciting and
 alive. =)
