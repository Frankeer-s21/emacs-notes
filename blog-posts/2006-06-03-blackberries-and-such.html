You've really got to get a comment system working on your blog :)

There are a lot of new interesting devices that are better and less
locked down than the Blackberry. I'm writing this email from one right
now, a Nokia E61. It has wifi and can make SIP calls in addition to
regular phone calls! Also, it runs Python. It's expensive, but only
about the same as a new new Blackberry.

I've just yesterday started a backpack page about my working with it,
at
<a href="http://johnsu01.backpackit.com/pub/613005"><a href="http://johnsu01.backpackit.com/pub/613005">http://johnsu01.backpackit.com/pub/613005</a></a>.

Nokia also appears to be heading rapidly down the FLOSS path, and I
\<sub>know\</sub>_ you'll be wanting to hack your device. :)

Well, if someone wants to hack together Planner + a nice non-spammy
comment system, I'd love to test it. I used to use blogKomm, but I
needed to modify it at some point and the code was in German. Not quite
fu.
</p>

<p>
Ooooh, wifi is good.
</p>

<p>
I've been doing okay with my laptop so far. It's actually more
 portable than I thought. Might try the Vaio for even more fun and
 profit. =) And yes, I'd rather have a hackable device than something
 that Just Works for everyone but me&#x2026; ;)

The very old woman thought for a while and then she said, I know! We
will let the cats decide which one we should keep.
