This is almost exactly what I do with planner. I try to keep commits
 as small and self-contained as possible. Not only does it make it
 easier to roll back (although I still have to figure out how to mark
 certain changesets as do-not-use, aside from deleting them from the
 revision library), but it also makes it possible for people to
 cherry-pick changes.
</p>

<p>
This works to my advantage as well, as other people are encouraged to
 make their patches nice and small. I still have to hand-tweak some
 changes. For example, Gary Vaughan uses a different tree structure.
 However, I can review the patch logs and merge the changes in
 manually.
