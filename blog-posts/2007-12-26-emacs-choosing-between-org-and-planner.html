<a href="http://sachachua.com/wp/2007/12/23/one-day-with-planner/#comment-177">asked
me</a> why I switched from Planner to Org. Both of them are popular
personal information managers for Emacs, and both of them have
practically all the features I need. They both do a good job at helping
people
 manage tasks, schedule, and notes. If you have a few
 months to explore this, I suggest that you try both for at least a
 month each. On the other hand, if you want quick results, some time
 thinking about how you plan can save you more time later.
</p>

<p>
I tried out Org because I was working on a chapter about schedule
 management and it wasn't fair to just rely on the manual or the
 mailing list. In the beginning, I
 <a href="http://sachachua.com/wp/2007/10/10/planner-and-org/">felt
frustrated</a> by the lack of things I'd gotten used to in Planner:
 the freedom to edit anything on my day page, little conveniences like
+2tue to mean two Tuesdays from now (which Carsten has just added),
publishing my blog&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
After two months of using Org almost every day, I'm starting to
 understand it. I've come to appreciate the ease of working with an
 outline. I love the way it clocks time. I find the daily and weekly
 views really helpful. I've hacked stuff for it: time/load estimation,
 time reporting, next action summaries, agenda publishing&#x2026; I'm fairly
deeply
</p>

<p>
As a geek, I have to confess&#x2014;I like Planner more. Planner is more fun
 to code. Maybe it's because I've spent years with it, and I know my
 way around the source.
</p>

<p>
Maybe it's because we split Planner up into lots of little pieces that
 can be reused and advised. Maybe the modularity of Planner is because
 chunks of the code were written on a computer with a teensy screen,
 which forced me to write functions that fit 80Ã—48 characters. (See,
 that limitation was there for a reason!) There are plenty of entry
 points. From time to time, I still find myself copying an entire
 function in order to change something in the middle, but usually I can
 just get away with wrapping something around something else. With Org,
 I find myself doing a lot of copy-and-paste programming. I'd fix this
 by breaking the functions down into smaller bits, but I don't have the
 brainspace right now. Maybe after the book.
</p>

<p>
Org is better for my brain, though. It gives me a better overview of
 both the ground-level tasks (what am I going to do right now, today,
 this week) as well as the 50,000-foot view (what are my big projects)?
 Planner's good at the ground-level tasks, but the overview's always
 been a little awkward because it has to visit a number of files to get
 a big picture. Org handles that easily.
</p>

<p>
And the one-place-for-data thing of Org is pretty cool, too. Org
 dynamically generates reports, which could take a bit longer if you
 have a large Org file. Planner copies data wherever it makes sense, so
 you'd have a copy of the task on your day page and a copy of the task
 on your plan page. Plan pages can get out of sync unless you're either
 religious about using planner-edit-task-description and other
 functions to edit your tasks, or you use planner-id and you're lucky.
 Timeclock entries get out of sync, too. You can trust Org more than
 Planner in terms of consistency.
</p>

<p>
So now I'm kinda in the middle of these two modules. I use Org for all
 my work tasks, and I'm moving towards using it for all of my personal
 tasks as well. But I still keep my blog entries in Planner, even
 though they get mirrored into a WordPress blog on my web server.
</p>

<p>
<b>What would I recommend?</b>
</p>

<p>
It depends on the way you think. If you're the kind of person who was
 never happy with day planners because you needed more space to doodle,
 write notes, move things around, add other things, try out Planner. If
 you like outlines and organizing your tasks into projects, try out
 Org.
</p>

<p>
Note that just because you work that way now doesn't mean you'll work
 that way in the future. Don't worry. Emacs will adapt. You can switch
 between Planner and Org fairly easily. Just give yourself a week or so
 to adjust (or a month if you've customized your old tool extensively
 and miss lots of things about it). Use the tool every day, and you'll
 be fine.
</p>

<p>
Have you tried out both? Or have you tried out one of them and are
curious about the other? I'd love to learn from your experience or
answer your questions.
